Associations between hypertension and birth outcomes using recently updated BP cutoffs are undetermined. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the impact of LNSs on maternal hypertension and associations between hypertension and birth outcomes. METHODS: Pregnant Ghanaian women at </=20 weeks of gestation (n = 1320) were randomly assigned to receive daily 1) iron and folic acid (IFA), 2) multiple micronutrients (MMN), or 3) LNSs until delivery. BP was measured at enrollment and 36 weeks of gestation. We analyzed the effect of LNSs on BP using ANOVA and associations between hypertension [systolic BP (SBP) >/=130 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) >/=80 mm Hg] and birth outcomes by linear and logistic regressions. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD SBP and DBP were 110 +/- 11 and 63 +/- 8 mm Hg at 36 weeks of gestation and did not differ by supplementation group (SBP, P > 0.05; DBP, P > 0.05). At enrollment, higher DBP was associated with lower birth weight and shorter gestation; women with high DBP had greater risk of low birth weight (LBW) [risk ratio (RR): 2.58; 95% CI: 1.09, 6.08] and preterm birth (PTB) (RR: 3.30; 95% CI: 1.47, 7.40). At 36 weeks of gestation, higher SBP was associated with lower birth weight, length, and head circumference and shorter gestation; higher DBP was associated with lower birth weight and length; and women with high DBP had greater risk of LBW (RR: 3.39; 95% CI: 1.32, 8.69). Neither high SBP nor hypertension were associated with birth outcomes at either time point. CONCLUSIONS: Daily provision of LNSs does not affect maternal hypertension, compared with IFA and MMN. Higher SBP and DBP are associated with a shorter gestation and smaller birth size; however, only high DBP is associated with LBW and PTB. The new BP cutoffs may help identify pregnancies at risk of adverse birth outcomes.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00970866.","2021-06","2024-02-20 10:59:45","2024-02-20 10:59:45","","1637-1645","","6","151","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 6 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>: </strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type : </strong></p> <p>Health facility</p> <p><strong>Description : </strong></p> <p>Prenatal clinics in <span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)"">Yilo and Manya Krobo districts of Ghana</span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong> <span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)"">1320</span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *birth outcomes; *Blood Pressure; *Dietary Supplements; *Ghana; *Hypertension/complications; *low birth weight; *maternal blood pressure; *maternal hypertension; *Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; *Pregnancy Complications; *Premature Birth; *prenatal supplements; *preterm birth; Birth Weight; Cohort Studies; Folic Acid; Ghana; Infant, Newborn; Iron; Lipids; Micronutrients; Vitamins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that postpartum infection incidence and attributable mortality in Mbarara, Uganda would be higher in HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected women. We performed a prospective cohort study of 4231 women presenting to a regional referral hospital in 2015 for delivery or postpartum care. All febrile or hypothermic women, and a subset of randomly selected normothermic women were followed during hospitalization and with 6-week postpartum phone interviews. The primary outcome was in-hospital postpartum infection. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital complications (mortality, re-operation, intensive care unit transfer, need for imaging or blood transfusion) and 6-week mortality. We performed multivariable regression analyses to estimate adjusted differences in each outcome by HIV serostatus. Mean age was 25.2 years and 481 participants (11%) were HIV-infected. Median CD4+ count was 487 (IQR 325, 696) cells/mm(3), and 90% of HIV-infected women (193/215 selected for in-depth survey) were on antiretroviral therapy. Overall, 5% (205/4231) of women developed fever or hypothermia. Cumulative in-hospital postpartum infection incidence was 2.0% and did not differ by HIV status (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 0.6-3.3, P = 0.49). However, more HIV-infected women developed postpartum complications (4.4% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.001). In-hospital mortality was rare (2/1768, 0.1%), and remained so at 6 weeks (4/1526, 0.3%), without differences by HIV serostatus (P = 1.0 and 0.31, respectively). For women in rural Uganda with high rates of antiretroviral therapy coverage, HIV infection did not predict postpartum infection or mortality, but was associated with increased risk of postpartum complications.","2018-08","2024-02-20 10:59:45","2024-02-20 10:59:45","","943-953","","8","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 8 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name : &nbsp;</strong>Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH)</p> <p><strong>Location Type : </strong>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description : </strong>Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in Mbarara, Uganda</p> <p><strong>Sample size : </strong>4,231</p> </div>","C:\Users\leon.mbano\Zotero\storage\QGC6VUXD\Bebell LM et al. - 2018 - HIV Infection and risk of postpartum infection, co.pdf","","*HIV; eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; *Africa; *antiretroviral; *infection; *Maternal Mortality; *Postpartum Period; *pregnancy; *puerperal sepsis; *Rural Population; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; HIV Infections/*complications/epidemiology/mortality; Hospitalization; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*epidemiology/mortality; Prospective Studies; Uganda/epidemiology; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because MiP is a complex phenomenon and malaria epidemiology is rapidly changing, additional evidence is still required to understand how best to control malaria. This study followed a prospective cohort of pregnant women who had access to intensive malaria screening and prompt treatment to identify factors associated with increased risk of MiP and to analyse how various characteristics of MiP affect delivery outcomes. METHODS: Between October 2006 and May 2009, 1,218 pregnant women were enrolled in a prospective cohort. After an initial assessment, they were screened weekly for malaria. At delivery, blood smears were obtained from the mother, placenta, cord and newborn. Multivariate analyses were performed to analyse the association between mothers' characteristics and malaria risk, as well as between MiP and birth outcome, length and weight at birth. This study is a secondary analysis of a trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00495508. RESULTS: Overall, 288/1,069 (27%) mothers had 345 peripheral malaria infections. The risk of peripheral malaria was higher in mothers who were younger, infected with HIV, had less education, lived in rural areas or reported no bed net use, whereas the risk of placental infection was associated with more frequent malaria infections and with infection during late pregnancy. The risk of pre-term delivery and of miscarriage was increased in mothers infected with HIV, living in rural areas and with MiP occurring within two weeks of delivery.In adjusted analysis, birth weight but not length was reduced in babies of mothers exposed to MiP (-60 g, 95%CI: -120 to 0 for at least one infection and -150 g, 95%CI: -280 to -20 for >1 infections). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the timing, parasitaemia level and number of peripherally-detected malaria infections, but not the presence of fever, were associated with adverse birth outcomes. Hence, prompt malaria detection and treatment should be offered to pregnant women regardless of symptoms or other preventive measures used during pregnancy, and with increased focus on mothers living in remote areas.","2013-04","2024-02-20 10:59:45","2024-02-20 10:59:45","","139","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type : </strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description : </strong><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Facilities in Mbarara district, southwestern Uganda</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size : </strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1,218&nbsp;</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Uganda/epidemiology; Young Adult; *Pregnancy Outcome; Blood/parasitology; Malaria/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/parasitology; Male; Parasite Load; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology; Premature Birth/*epidemiology; Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low and middle income countries like Nigeria bear a higher burden of antepartum depression compared with high income countries. Prioritizing mental health issues among pregnant women is crucial to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We determined the prevalence, associated factors and perinatal outcomes of antepartum depression among pregnant women in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 1745 pregnant women enrolled early in pregnancy (</= 20 weeks) at four comprehensive obstetric facilities within Ibadan metropolis. Antepartum depression was ascertained during the third trimester using the Edinburg Postpartum Depression Scale >/= 12. The primary exposure was antepartum depression and the outcome variables were the perinatal outcomes. The associated factors assessed included sociodemographic, obstetric, psychological, and lifestyle characteristics. Bi-variate logistic and Poisson regression analyses were used to assess the factors and relative risk for perinatal outcomes of antepartum depression. RESULTS: The prevalence of antepartum depression was 14.1%. The significant factors associated with APD after adjusting for confounders were: high income (>/= 20, 000) which was protective (AOR) = 0.59; 95% CI: (0.40 - 0.88); p-value: 0.010] and perceived stress increased the odds of APD in a monotonic fashion: moderate stress [AOR = 2.39; 95% CI: (1.01 - 5.7); p-value: 0.047], high stress [AOR = 6.43; 95% CI: (2.28 - 18.2); p-value: < 0.001]. Preterm delivery was the only significant perinatal outcome [Relative Risk (RR) = 1.66; 95% CI (1.14 - 2.39); p-value = 0.007]. Depression did not increase the risk of having low birth weight babies (p = 0.513), macrosomia (p = 0.894), birth asphyxia (p = 0.317), and caesarean section (p = 0.298). CONCLUSIONS: APD was prevalent among our study population. The significant factors identified in this study can be targeted to reduce the occurrence of APD among pregnant women in Nigeria through appropriate social and public health interventions which include APD screening, counselling, and the provision of emotional support for pregnant women during antenatal care.","2022-03","2024-02-20 10:59:45","2024-02-20 10:59:45","","219","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">University College Hospital, Adeoyo Maternity Teaching Hospital, Jericho Specialist Hospital, Saint Mary Catholic Hospital</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in four hospitals in Ibadan, the capital city of Oyo State, southwest, Nigeria.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1745</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Nigeria; Risk Factors; Antepartum depression; Birth outcomes; Depression/*psychology; Maternal health; Mental health; Nigeria/epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications/*psychology; Pregnancy Outcome/epidemiology; Prevalence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: A prospective study. We used frequencies for descriptive analysis, chi(2) test for associations and logistic regression to derive the prediction model. Discrimination was estimated by the c-statistic. Calibration was assessed by calibration plot of actual versus predicted probability. SETTING: Primary care antenatal clinics in Ghana. PARTICIPANTS: 2529 pregnant women in the development cohort and 647 pregnant women in the validation cohort. Inclusion criterion was women without chronic hypertension. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Gestational hypertension. RESULTS: Predictors of GH were diastolic blood pressure, family history of hypertension in parents, history of GH in a previous pregnancy, parity, height and weight. The c-statistic of the original model was 0.70 (95% CI 0.67-0.74) and 0.68 (0.60 to 0.77) in the validation cohort. Calibration was good in both cohorts. The negative predictive value of women in the development cohort at high risk of GH was 92.0% compared to 94.0% in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction model showed adequate performance after validation in an independent cohort and can be used to classify women into high, moderate or low risk of developing GH. It contributes to efforts to provide clinical decision-making support to improve maternal health and birth outcomes.","2017-01","2024-02-20 10:59:45","2024-02-20 10:59:45","","e012670","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified </p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Six Primary care antenatal clinics &nbsp;in the Greater Accra region of Ghana</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">2529</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Ghana; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; *gestational hypertension; *hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; *prediction model; *predictors; *risk scores; Clinical Decision-Making/*methods; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced/*diagnosis; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to explore the association between antenatal depression and anxiety symptoms and birth outcomes in a low-obstetric risk sample of mother/child dyads in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS: In 2010-2011, a prospective cohort of 1030 women in their third trimester in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire was enrolled. Depression and anxiety were assessed in the third trimester using the Patient Health Questionnaire depression module and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. 719 mother/child dyads were included in the analysis. We constructed multivariate regression models to estimate the association between CMD and low birth weight (LBW), and preterm birth (PTB) to control for potential confounders. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were 28.9% and 14.2% respectively. The mean birth weight was 3172.1g (SD 440.6) and the prevalence of LBW was 1.7%. The mean gestational age was 39.6 weeks and the proportion of PTB was 4%. Multivariate linear regression revealed no significant association between maternal depression (B=52.2, 95% CI -18.2 122.6, p=0.15) or anxiety (B=17.1, 95% CI -74.6 108.7, p=0.72) and birth weight. Yet, low socio-economic status, female sex of the child, and younger maternal age were associated with lower birth weight. Multivariate logistic regression suggested no significant association between maternal depression (OR: 2.1, 95% CI 0.8 5.6, p=0.15) or anxiety (OR: 1.8, 95% CI 0.6 5.5, p=0.29) with PTB. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that depression and/or anxiety in the 3(rd) trimester of pregnancy are not independent predictors of adverse birth outcomes in low obstetric risk women. The role of pregnancy complications as confounders or effect modifiers in studies of maternal CMD and their impact on birth outcomes should be investigated.","2013","2024-02-20 10:59:45","2024-02-20 10:59:45","","e80711","","11","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 11 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Komfo Anokye Hospital , Abobo Hospital </span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description : </strong><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Hospitals, the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, and the Abobo Community Hospital in Abidjan, CôteGhana and Côte d’Ivoire</span></span></p> <p><strong>sample size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1030&nbsp;</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Pregnancy Complications; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Anxiety/epidemiology; Cote d'Ivoire/epidemiology; Depression/epidemiology; Ghana/epidemiology; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Disorders/*epidemiology; Pregnancy Outcome/*epidemiology; Pregnancy Trimester, Third","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However little or no information exists in our sub-region on this subject. Identifying the factors associated with preterm delivery in HIV positive women in our country and sub-region will not only prevent mother to child transmission of HIV virus but will also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with prematurity and low birth weight. This study was designed to determine the incidence and risk factors for preterm delivery in HIV positive Nigerians. METHOD: The required data for this retrospective study was extracted from the data base of a cohort study of the outcome of prevention of mother to child transmission at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Lagos. Only data of women that met the eligibility of spontaneous delivery after 20 weeks of gestation were included. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institution's Ethical Review Board. RESULTS: 181 women out of the 1626 eligible for inclusion into the study had spontaneous preterm delivery (11.1%). The mean birth weight was 3.1 +/- 0.4 kg, with 10.3% having LBW. Spontaneous preterm delivery was found to be significantly associated with unmarried status (cOR: 1.7;1.52-2.57), baseline CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) (cOR: 1.8; 1.16-2.99), presence of opportunistic infection at delivery (cOR: 2.2;1.23-3.57), multiple pregnancy (cOR 10.4; 4.24 - 26.17), use of PI based triple ARV therapy (eOR 10.2; 5.52 - 18.8) in the first trimester (cOR 2.5; 1.77 - 3.52) on univariate analysis. However after multivariate analysis controlling for potential confounding variables including low birth weight, only multiple pregnancy (aOR: 8.6; CI: 6.73 - 12.9), presence of opportunistic infection at delivery (aOR: 1.9; CI: 1.1 - 5.7), and 1st trimester exposure to PI based triple therapy (aOR: 5.4; CI: 3.4 - 7.8) retained their significant association with preterm delivery. CONCLUSION: The spontaneous preterm delivery rate among our cohort was 11.1%. HIV positive women with multiple pregnancies, symptomatic HIV infection at delivery and first trimester fetal exposure to PI based triple therapy were found to be at risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. Early booking and non-use of PI based triple therapy in the first trimester will significantly reduce the risk of preterm delivery.","2012-09","2024-02-20 10:59:44","2024-02-20 10:59:44","","93","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, </span></span><span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi Araba, &nbsp;Ikeja, General Hospitals Surulere, Apapa, Ikorodu ,Havana Specialist Hospital Surulere, Rao Specialist Hospital Surulere ,</span></span></p> <p></p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Research Institute</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">The study was conducted at the HIV treatment centre, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Lagos, with patients receiving care and treatment at this centre and other collaborating healthcare facilities in Lagos and surrounding areas</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1626</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult; *Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth/*epidemiology; Risk Factors; Nigeria/epidemiology; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Antirheumatic Agents/therapeutic use; HIV Seropositivity/drug therapy/*epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*epidemiology; Viral Load","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to study the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical management of miscarriage in low-income countries. METHODS: We did an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis using data from 3412 women recruited to the AIMS trial, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical management of miscarriage in Malawi, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda. Economic evaluation was done from a health-care-provider perspective on the basis of the outcome of cost per pelvic infection avoided within 2 weeks of surgery. Pelvic infection was broadly defined by the presence of clinical features or the clinically identified need to administer antibiotics. We used non-parametric bootstrapping and multilevel random effects models to estimate incremental mean costs and outcomes. Decision uncertainty was shown via cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers. The AIMS trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN97143849. FINDINGS: Between June 2, 2014, and April 26, 2017, 3412 women were assigned to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis (1705 [50%] of 3412) or placebo (1707 [50%] of 3412) in the AIMS trial. 158 (5%) of 3412 women developed pelvic infection within 2 weeks of surgery, of whom 68 (43%) were in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 90 (57%) in the placebo group. There is 97-98% probability that antibiotic prophylaxis is a cost-effective intervention at expected thresholds of willingness-to-pay per additional pelvic infection avoided. In terms of post-surgery antibiotics, the antibiotic prophylaxis group was US$0.27 (95% CI -0.49 to -0.05) less expensive per woman than the placebo group. A secondary analysis, a sensitivity analysis, and all subgroup analyses supported these findings. Antibiotic prophylaxis, if implemented routinely before miscarriage surgery, could translate to an annual total cost saving of up to $1.4 million across the four participating countries and up to $8.5 million across the two regions of sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. INTERPRETATION: Antibiotic prophylaxis is more effective and less expensive than no antibiotic prophylaxis. Policy makers in various settings should be confident that antibiotic prophylaxis in miscarriage surgery is cost-effective.

However, most data came from hospitals, which do not include neonates who did not seek care or were treated outside the hospital. Studies from the community are scarce, and few among those available were conducted with high-quality microbiological techniques. The burden of SBI at the community level is therefore largely unknown. We aimed here to describe the incidence, etiology, risk factors, and antibiotic resistance profiles of community-acquired neonatal SBI in 3 LMICs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The BIRDY study is a prospective multicentric community-based mother and child cohort study and was conducted in both urban and rural areas in Madagascar (2012 to 2018), Cambodia (2014 to 2018), and Senegal (2014 to 2018). All pregnant women within a geographically defined population were identified and enrolled. Their neonates were actively followed from birth to 28 days to document all episodes of SBI. A total of 3,858 pregnant women (2,273 (58.9%) in Madagascar, 814 (21.1%) in Cambodia, and 771 (20.0%) in Senegal) were enrolled in the study, and, of these, 31.2% were primigravidae. Women enrolled in the urban sites represented 39.6% (900/2,273), 45.5% (370/814), and 61.9% (477/771), and those enrolled in the rural sites represented 60.4% (1,373/2,273), 54.5% (444/814), and 38.1% (294/771) of the total in Madagascar, Cambodia, and Senegal, respectively. Among the 3,688 recruited newborns, 49.6% were male and 8.7% were low birth weight (LBW). The incidence of possible severe bacterial infection (pSBI; clinical diagnosis based on WHO guidelines of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness) was 196.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 176.5 to 218.2], 110.1 [88.3 to 137.3], and 78.3 [59.5 to 103] per 1,000 live births in Madagascar, Cambodia, and Senegal, respectively. The incidence of pSBI differed between urban and rural sites in all study countries. In Madagascar, we estimated an incidence of 161.0 pSBI per 1,000 live births [133.5 to 194] in the urban site and 219.0 [192.6 to 249.1] pSBI per 1,000 live births in the rural site (p = 0.008). In Cambodia, estimated incidences were 141.1 [105.4 to 189.0] and 85.3 [61.0 to 119.4] pSBI per 1,000 live births in urban and rural sites, respectively (p = 0.025), while in Senegal, we estimated 103.6 [76.0 to 141.2] pSBI and 41.5 [23.0 to 75.0] pSBI per 1,000 live births in urban and rural sites, respectively (p = 0.006). The incidences of culture-confirmed SBI were 15.2 [10.6 to 21.8], 6.5 [2.7 to 15.6], and 10.2 [4.8 to 21.3] per 1,000 live births in Madagascar, Cambodia, and Senegal, respectively, with no difference between urban and rural sites in each country. The great majority of early-onset infections occurred during the first 3 days of life (72.7%). The 3 main pathogens isolated were Klebsiella spp. (11/45, 24.4%), Escherichia coli (10/45, 22.2%), and Staphylococcus spp. (11/45, 24.4%). Among the 13 gram-positive isolates, 5 were resistant to gentamicin, and, among the 29 gram-negative isolates, 13 were resistant to gentamicin, with only 1 E. coli out of 10 sensitive to ampicillin. Almost one-third of the isolates were resistant to both first-line drugs recommended for the management of neonatal sepsis (ampicillin and gentamicin). Overall, 38 deaths occurred among neonates with SBI (possible and culture-confirmed SBI together). LBW and foul-smelling amniotic fluid at delivery were common risk factors for early pSBI in all 3 countries. A main limitation of the study was the lack of samples from a significant proportion of infants with pBSI including 35 neonatal deaths. Without these samples, bacterial infection and resistance profiles could not be confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed a high incidence of neonatal SBI, particularly in the first 3 days of life, in the community of 3 LMICs. The current treatment for the management of neonatal infection is hindered by antimicrobial resistance. Our findings suggest that microbiological diagnosis of SBI remains a challenge in these settings and support more research on causes of neonatal death and the implementation of early interventions (e.g., follow-up of at-risk newborns during the first days of life) to decrease the burden of neonatal SBI and associated mortality and help achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3.","2021-09","2024-02-20 10:59:43","2024-02-20 10:59:43","","e1003681","","9","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 9 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name : </strong>Antananarivo,Moramanga,Guédiawaye , Sokone</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247)"">health facilities and communities</span></span></p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <ol> <li> <p><span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Madagascar</span></span></p> <ul> <li> <span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">3 urban districts of Antananarivo (population: 14,997)</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Rural city of Moramanga (population: 17,159)</span></span> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Cambodia</span></span></p> <ul> <li> <span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">2 areas of Steung Meanchey, an urban district of Phnom Penh (population: 87,035)</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">2 districts of rural Kampong Speu (79,000 inhabitants)</span></span> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Senegal</span></span></p> <ul> <li> <span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">District of Guédiawaye, a city near urban Dakar (population: 20,529)</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Rural city of Sokone, close to the Gambia border (population: 14,500)</span></span> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">2,273 (58.9%) in Madagascar, 814 (21.1%) in Cambodia, and 771 (20.0%) in Senegal)&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/microbiology; Cambodia/epidemiology; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Madagascar/epidemiology; Patient Acuity; Senegal/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sepsis contributes significantly to both maternal and newborn mortality, and safe delivery kits have long been promoted as a cost-effective intervention to ensure hygienic delivery practices and reduce sepsis. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of home birth kit distribution by community health workers, and particularly the impact of this intervention on health outcomes. This paper reports a secondary analysis of data from a cluster randomized trial in rural northern Nigeria in which birth kits were distributed by community health workers to pregnant women in their homes, analyzing non-experimental variation in receipt and use of birth kits. More specifically, associations between pregnant women's baseline characteristics and receipt and use of birth kits, and associations between birth kit use, care utilization and maternal and newborn outcomes were assessed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Baseline, post-birth and endline data related to 3,317 births observed over a period of three years in 72 intervention communities in Jigawa state, Nigeria, were analyzed using hierarchical, logistic regression models. In total, 140 women received birth kits, and 72 women used the kits. There were no associations between baseline demographic characteristics, health history, and knowledge and attitudes and receipt of a kit, suggesting that community health workers did not systematically target the distribution of birth kits. However, women who used the kit reported reduced odds of past pregnancy complications (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.19-1.00) as well as significantly higher odds of feeling generally healthy at baseline (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.06-3.76), of exposure to radio media (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.21-3.22), and of perceiving themselves as having a low-risk pregnancy (OR = 3.05, 95% CI:1.39-6.68). While there were no significant associations between birth kit use and facility based delivery, skilled birth attendance or post-natal care, women who used a kit exhibited significantly lower odds of completing four or more ANC visits (adjusted OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.18-0.85) and significantly higher odds of reporting prolonged labor (adjusted OR = 4.75, 95% CI: 1.36-16.59), and post-partum bleeding (adjusted OR = 3.25, 95% CI: 1.11-9.52). CONCLUSIONS: This evidence suggests that use of birth kits is low in a rural population characterized by minimal baseline utilization of maternal and neonatal health services, and the use of birth kits was not associated with reductions in maternal or neonatal morbidity. While further research is required to understand how the effectiveness of birth kits may be shaped by the mechanism through which women access and utilize the kits, our findings suggest that the provision of kits to women outside of the formal health system may be associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.","2018","2024-02-20 10:59:43","2024-02-20 10:59:43","","e0208885","","12","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 12 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Communities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">72 </span></span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Intervention communities within Jigawa state, Nigeria.</span></p> <p><strong>Sample size : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">3,317</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Nigeria; Pregnancy Outcome; *Maternal Health Services; Pregnant Women; Rural Population; *Infant Health; *Maternal Health; *Prenatal Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We conducted a multicountry, randomized trial involving pregnant women between 26 weeks 0 days and 33 weeks 6 days of gestation who were at risk for preterm birth. The participants were assigned to intramuscular dexamethasone or identical placebo. The primary outcomes were neonatal death alone, stillbirth or neonatal death, and possible maternal bacterial infection; neonatal death alone and stillbirth or neonatal death were evaluated with superiority analyses, and possible maternal bacterial infection was evaluated with a noninferiority analysis with the use of a prespecified margin of 1.25 on the relative scale. RESULTS: A total of 2852 women (and their 3070 fetuses) from 29 secondary- and tertiary-level hospitals across Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan underwent randomization. The trial was stopped for benefit at the second interim analysis. Neonatal death occurred in 278 of 1417 infants (19.6%) in the dexamethasone group and in 331 of 1406 infants (23.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.97; P = 0.03). Stillbirth or neonatal death occurred in 393 of 1532 fetuses and infants (25.7%) and in 444 of 1519 fetuses and infants (29.2%), respectively (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.99; P = 0.04); the incidence of possible maternal bacterial infection was 4.8% and 6.3%, respectively (relative risk, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.03). There was no significant between-group difference in the incidence of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Among women in low-resource countries who were at risk for early preterm birth, the use of dexamethasone resulted in significantly lower risks of neonatal death alone and stillbirth or neonatal death than the use of placebo, without an increase in the incidence of possible maternal bacterial infection.

HCV is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) but data on HCV/HIV co-infection in pregnancy is limited. We estimated the prevalence of and risk factors for HCV/HIV co-infection among pregnant women in the Kinshasa province of the DRC. This cross-sectional study was conducted as a sub-study of an ongoing randomized trial to assess continuous quality improvement interventions (CQI) for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV (CQI-PMTCT study, NCT03048669). HIV-infected women in the CQI-PMTCT cohort were tested for HCV, and risk factors were evaluated using logistic regression. The prevalence of HCV/HIV co-infection among Congolese women was 0.83% (95% CI 0.43-1.23). Women who tested positive for HCV were younger, more likely to live in urban areas, and more likely to test positive during pregnancy versus postpartum. HCV-positive women had significantly higher odds of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (aOR 13.87 [3.29,58.6]). An inverse relationship was noted between HCV infection and the overall capacity of the health facility as measured by the service readiness index (SRI) (aOR:0.92 [0.86,0.98] per unit increase). Women who presented to rural, for-profit and PEPFAR-funded health facilities were more likely to test positive for HCV. In summary, this study identified that the prevalence of HCV/HIV co-infection was < 1% among Congolese women. We also identified HBV infection as a major risk factor for HCV/HIV co-infection. Individuals with triple infection should be linked to care and the facility-related differences in HCV prevalence should be addressed in future studies.","2022-01","2024-02-20 10:59:41","2024-02-20 10:59:41","","1384","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">105 sites in Kinshasa province&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>2490</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Middle Aged; Adolescent; *Quality of Health Care; Coinfection/*epidemiology/virology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Hepacivirus/*isolation & purification; Hepatitis B virus/*isolation & purification; Hepatitis B/*epidemiology/virology; Hepatitis C/*epidemiology/virology; HIV Infections/*epidemiology/virology; HIV/*isolation & purification; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*epidemiology/virology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global health","","2214-109X (LINKING)","10.1016/S2214-109X(19)30036-1","","BACKGROUND: Maternal and neonatal mortality is high in Africa, but few large, prospective studies have been done to investigate the risk factors associated with these poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: A 7-day, international, prospective, observational cohort study was done in patients having caesarean delivery in 183 hospitals across 22 countries in Africa. The inclusion criteria were all consecutive patients (aged >/=18 years) admitted to participating centres having elective and non-elective caesarean delivery during the 7-day study cohort period. To ensure a representative sample, each hospital had to provide data for 90% of the eligible patients during the recruitment week. The primary outcome was in-hospital maternal mortality and complications, which were assessed by local investigators. The study was registered on the South African National Health Research Database, number KZ_2015RP7_22, and on ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03044899. FINDINGS: Between February, 2016, and May, 2016, 3792 patients were recruited from hospitals across Africa. 3685 were included in the postoperative complications analysis (107 missing data) and 3684 were included in the maternal mortality analysis (108 missing data). These hospitals had a combined number of specialist surgeons, obstetricians, and anaesthetists totalling 0.7 per 100 000 population (IQR 0.2-2.0). Maternal mortality was 20 (0.5%) of 3684 patients (95% CI 0.3-0.8). Complications occurred in 633 (17.4%) of 3636 mothers (16.2-18.6), which were predominantly severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding (136 [3.8%] of 3612 mothers). Maternal mortality was independently associated with a preoperative presentation of placenta praevia, placental abruption, ruptured uterus, antepartum haemorrhage (odds ratio 4.47 [95% CI 1.46-13.65]), and perioperative severe obstetric haemorrhage (5.87 [1.99-17.34]) or anaesthesia complications (11.47 (1.20-109.20]). Neonatal mortality was 153 (4.4%) of 3506 infants (95% CI 3.7-5.0). INTERPRETATION: Maternal mortality after caesarean delivery in Africa is 50 times higher than that of high-income countries and is driven by peripartum haemorrhage and anaesthesia complications. Neonatal mortality is double the global average. Early identification and appropriate management of mothers at risk of peripartum haemorrhage might improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in Africa.

Whilst CMV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are both endemic in SSA, the relationship between antenatal plasma CMV-DNA, HIV-1-RNA levels and HIV-1-mother to child transmission (MTCT) including pregnancy outcomes remains poorly described. METHODS: Pregnant women at least 20 weeks' gestational age at enrolment were recruited from relatively poor high-density suburbs in Harare, Zimbabwe. Mother-infant dyads were followed up until 6 months postpartum. In a case-control study design, we tested antenatal plasma CMV-DNA levels in all 11 HIV-1 transmitting mothers, as well as randomly selected HIV-infected but non-transmitting mothers and HIV-uninfected controls. CMV-DNA was detected and quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Antenatal plasma HIV-1-RNA load was quantified by reverse transcriptase PCR. Infants' HIV-1 infection was detected using qualitative proviral DNA-PCR. Predictive value of antenatal plasma CMV-DNAemia (CMV-DNA of > 50 copies/mL) for HIV-1-MTCT was analyzed in univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Associations of CMV-DNAemia with HIV-1-RNA levels and pregnancy outcomes were also explored. RESULTS: CMV-DNAemia data were available for 11 HIV-1 transmitting mothers, 120 HIV-infected but non-transmitting controls and 46 HIV-uninfected mothers. In a multivariate logistic regression model, we found a significant association between CMV-DNAemia of > 50 copies/mL and HIV-1 vertical transmission (p = 0.035). There was no difference in frequencies of detectable CMV-DNAemia between HIV-infected and -uninfected pregnant women (p = 0.841). However, CMV-DNA levels were higher in immunosuppressed HIV-infected pregnant women, CD4 < 200 cells/microL (p = 0.018). Non-significant associations of more preterm births (< 37 weeks, p = 0.063), and generally lower birth weights (< 2500 g, p = 0.450) were observed in infants born of HIV-infected mothers with CMV-DNAemia. Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis of HIV-infected but non-transmitting mothers, CMV-DNAemia of > 50 copies/mL correlated significantly with antenatal plasma HIV-1-RNA load (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Antenatal plasma CMV-DNA of > 50 copies/mL may be an independent risk factor for HIV-1-MTCT and higher plasma HIV-1-RNA load, raising the possibility that controlling antenatal CMV-DNAemia might improve infant health outcomes. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm our findings.","2021-01","2024-02-20 10:59:40","2024-02-20 10:59:40","","30","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Kuwadzana</span></span> Polyclinic<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">, Rujeko </span></span>Polyclinic<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">, Budiriro</span></span> Polyclinic<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> ,Glenview </span></span>Polyclinic</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health Facility</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">City of Harare Polyclinics, situated in the South-western high-density areas of Harare namely, Kuwadzana, Rujeko, Budiriro and Glenview</span></span><strong> </strong><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">High-density suburbs in Harare, Zimbabwe.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>1200</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Mothers; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; Pregnancy Outcome; Adolescent; Zimbabwe; Case-Control Studies; *Antenatal CMV-DNAemia; *Birth outcomes; *HIV-1 vertical transmission; *HIV-1-RNA load; *Infant health; Cytomegalovirus Infections/*blood; Cytomegalovirus/*genetics; DNA, Viral/*blood; HIV Infections/*transmission; HIV-1/genetics; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/virology; Prenatal Diagnosis/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimated population-based rates by standardised methods in 27 intervention clusters of the Community-Level Interventions for Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) cluster randomised trials. METHODS AND FINDINGS: CLIP-eligible pregnant women identified in their homes or local primary health centres (2013-2017). Included here are women who had delivered by trial end and received a visit from a community health worker trained to provide supplementary hypertension-oriented care, including standardised blood pressure (BP) measurement. Hypertension (BP >/= 140/90 mm Hg) was defined as chronic (first detected at <20 weeks gestation) or gestational (>/=20 weeks); pre-eclampsia was gestational hypertension plus proteinuria or a pre-eclampsia-defining complication. A multi-level regression model compared hypertension rates and types between countries (p < 0.05 considered significant). In 28,420 pregnancies studied, women were usually young (median age 23-28 years), parous (53.7%-77.3%), with singletons (>/=97.5%), and enrolled at a median gestational age of 10.4 (India) to 25.9 weeks (Mozambique). Basic education varied (22.8% in Pakistan to 57.9% in India). Pregnancy hypertension incidence was lower in Pakistan (9.3%) than India (10.3%), Mozambique (10.9%), or Nigeria (10.2%) (p = 0.001). Most hypertension was diastolic only (46.4% in India, 72.7% in Pakistan, 61.3% in Mozambique, and 63.3% in Nigeria). At first presentation with elevated BP, gestational hypertension was most common diagnosis (particularly in Mozambique [8.4%] versus India [6.9%], Pakistan [6.5%], and Nigeria [7.1%]; p < 0.001), followed by pre-eclampsia (India [3.8%], Nigeria [3.0%], Pakistan [2.4%], and Mozambique [2.3%]; p < 0.001) and chronic hypertension (especially in Mozambique [2.5%] and Nigeria [2.8%], compared with India [1.2%] and Pakistan [1.5%]; p < 0.001). Inclusion of additional diagnoses of hypertension and related complications, from household surveys or facility record review (unavailable in Nigeria), revealed higher hypertension incidence: 14.0% in India, 11.6% in Pakistan, and 16.8% in Mozambique; eclampsia was rare (<0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy hypertension is common in less-developed settings. Most women in this study presented with gestational hypertension amenable to surveillance and timed delivery to improve outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN: Subanalysis from a prospective cohort study (2009-2011) of women aged 18-49years accessing abortion services through 12weeks' gestation. Trained study personnel conducted structured interviews with women about their reason for having an abortion, experiences accessing services and costs incurred. Women who were 9weeks' gestation or less were eligible to choose medication abortion or manual vacuum aspiration (MVA); women 10-12weeks' gestation all had MVA. RESULTS: We enrolled 1167 women; 923 (79.1%) were eligible to choose their procedure. The median age was 25years; most were black African, single and unemployed. Many women reported concerns about the affordability of raising a(nother) child (58.9%) or not being ready for (more) children (43.4%) as their reason for having an abortion. In total, women incurred a median cost of US$9.99 (interquartile range 6.46-14.85) for their procedure which usually required two facility visits. Many had to pay for transportation, a pregnancy test, sanitary pads or pain medication. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of government assistance for children through South Africa's ""child grant,"" the affordability of raising a child was a major concern for women. Although theoretically available free of charge in the public sector, women experienced challenges accessing abortion services and incurred costs which may have been burdensome given average local earnings. These potential barriers could be addressed by reducing the number of required visits and improving availability of pregnancy tests and supplies in public facilities. IMPLICATIONS: Many women cited concerns about the affordability of having a(nother) child when requesting an abortion. Although public services are technically free or low-cost in South Africa, women incurred costs for first-trimester abortions. Women's costs could be lowered by reducing facility visits and improving availability of pregnancy tests and supplies.","2017-08","2024-02-20 10:59:40","2024-02-20 10:59:40","","72-80","","2","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)"">Public-sector facilities in KwaZulu-Natal,</span><span style=""color: rgb(55, 65, 81)""> a province in South Africa</span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(80, 80, 80)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1167</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Middle Aged; South Africa; Adolescent; Abortion, Induced/*economics/methods; Abortion, Legal/*economics/methods; Access; Costs; Economic; Health Services Accessibility/*economics; Health Surveys; Manual vacuum aspiration; Medication abortion; Operations Research; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Termination of pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While most antiretrovirals are considered safe in pregnancy, monitoring for rare pregnancy and infant adverse outcomes is warranted. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective secondary analysis nested within a clinical trial of infant cotrimoxazole vs. placebo prophylaxis in Botswana (the Mpepu Study). Infants were examined at birth, and at least every 3 months through 18 months of age. Abnormal physical findings and diagnostic testing revealing malformations were documented. Post hoc, a geneticist classified all reported malformations based on available documentation. Structural malformations with surgical, medical or cosmetic importance were classified as major malformations. We present a descriptive analysis of identified malformations. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2014, 2,933 HIV-infected women who enrolled in the Mpepu study delivered 2,971 live-born infants. Study staff conducted 2,944 (99%) newborn exams. One thousand eighty-eight (38%) women were taking ART at conception; 1,147 (40%) started ART during pregnancy; 442 (15%) received zidovudine monotherapy; and 223 (7%) received no antiretroviral during pregnancy. Of 33 reported anomalies, 25 (76%) met congenital malformations criteria, 10 (30%) were classified as major malformations, 4 (40%) of which were identified after the birth exam. DISCUSSION: Our results highlight the importance of staff training on identification of congenital malformations, programmatic monitoring beyond the birth examination and the value of geneticist involvement in the malformations classification process in resource-limited settings. These elements will be important to fully define antiretroviral drug safety in pregnancy. SIGNIFICANCE: Surveillance systems for monitoring the safety of antiretroviral use during pregnancy among HIV-infected women in resource-limited setting are lacking.

METHODS: One thousand sixty-five eligible women were assessed for CMD in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 2 months post-delivery using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire. We derived a four-level categorical exposure variable for the course of perinatal CMD. The outcome measure was child death recorded from 1 month after the postnatal assessment up to 3.5 years. Potential confounders and mediators were evaluated. RESULTS: The cumulative child mortality rates were 62.6/1000 at 1 year and 82.5/1000 at 3.5 years, respectively. Exposure to perinatal CMD did not significantly affect child survival at 3.5 years, with results showing fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.85 (0.43, 7.88) for CMD in pregnancy only, 1.47 (0.14, 15.66) for CMD in postnatal period only and 0.41 (0.02, 7.38) for persistent CMD (both in pregnancy and postnatal). Only using soap less frequently than daily (HR 5.67, 95% CI 1.58-20.30) and episode of malaria in pregnancy (HR 5.02, 95% CI 2.15-11.72) were associated with child mortality in multivariable analysis.

Isoniazid prevention therapy (IPT) strategy was implemented in South Africa concurrently with life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce the TB-associated morbidity and mortality in individuals living with HIV. This study assessed the extent of the implementation of IPT and the performance of the Mantoux test by geographic settings of health facilities and residences of pregnant women living with HIV in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a data analysis of 1709 pregnant women enrolled in the new electronic database of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme of the East London Prospective Cohort Study. Relevant data on place of residence and antenatal care, performance of the Mantoux test and subsequent initiation of IPT were obtained. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to analyse the geographical variations and accessibility to Mantoux test and IPT. RESULTS: The analysis shows that Mantoux test was performed on 803 pregnant women (47%) with significant geographical variation. After controlling for relevant covariates, pregnant women who resided in rural areas (AOR:0.63; CI: 0.47-0.84) compared to those who resided in urban areas were significantly less likely to receive Mantoux test. The rate of uptake of IPT was 79% with significant geographic variations. In the unadjusted model, rural place of residence (UOR:0.68; CI: 0.49-0.96) was independently associated with lower likelihood of uptake of INH prophylaxis; however, the effect was not significant after controlling for important covariates. CONCLUSIONS: The high uptake rate of isoniazid prevention therapy in pregnant women living with HIV at the study sites is commendable; however, concerted efforts are needed to address the inequality gaps in the roll-out of IPT. Poor performance of Mantoux test is a serious concern and requires the attention of TB programme managers and other relevant authorities.","2019-10","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","1407","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Frere Hospital, Cecilia Makiwane Hospital, Bisho Hospital</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Buffalo/Amathole districts in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Sample size :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">1709</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; Middle Aged; South Africa; Adolescent; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*drug therapy; HIV Infections/*drug therapy; *Healthcare Disparities; HIV-associated tuberculosis; Isoniazid prevention therapy; Isoniazid/*therapeutic use; Mantoux test; Maternal mortality; Tuberculin Test/*statistics & numerical data; Tuberculosis-associated morbidity; Tuberculosis-associated mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to investigate the effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy on adverse fetal outcomes at Gondar town public health facilities, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based prospective cohort study was performed among 1778 pregnant women who were booked for antenatal care in selected public health facilities from 29 October 2019 to 7 May 2020 in Gondar town. We used a two-stage random sampling technique to recruit and include participants in the cohort. Data were collected using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C) standardized and pre-tested questionnaire. Multivariable analysis was performed to examine the association between reported prenatal alcohol exposure (non-hazardous and hazardous) and interested adverse birth outcomes using log-binomial regression modeling. The burden of outcomes was reported using the adjusted risk ratio and population-attributable risk (PAR). RESULTS: A total of 1686 pregnant women were included in the analysis, which revealed that the incidences of low birth weight, preterm, and stillbirth were 12.63% (95% CI: 11.12, 14.31), 6.05% (95% CI: 5.00, 7.29) and 4.27% (95% CI: 3.4, 5.35), respectively. Non-hazardous and hazardous alcohol consumption during pregnancy was significantly associated with low birth weight (ARR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.98) and (ARR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.66, 3.30), respectively. Hazardous alcohol consumption during pregnancy was also significantly associated with preterm birth (ARR = 2.06; 95% CI: 1.21, 3.52). The adjusted PAR of low birth weight related to non-hazardous and hazardous alcohol drinking during pregnancy was 11.72 and 8.44%, respectively. The adjusted PAR of hazardous alcohol consumption was 6.80% for preterm. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is an increasing risk of adverse birth outcomes, particularly preterm delivery and low birth weight, with increasing levels of alcohol intake. This result showed that the prevention of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy has the potential to reduce low birth weight and preterm birth. Hence, screening women for alcohol use during antenatal care visits and providing advice with rigorous follow-up of women who used alcohol may save the fetus from the potential risks of adverse birth outcomes.","2021-08","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","64","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>University of Gondar specialized hospital, Gondar polyclinic, Azezo health centre, Maraki health centre.</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black"">Conducted in Gondar town, Ethiopia</span></p> <p><strong>Sample size : </strong><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1778</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Stillbirth; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Care; *Premature Birth/epidemiology; Ethiopia/epidemiology; *Adverse health outcomes; *Alcohol use; *Alcoholism; *Ethiopia; *Pregnant women; *Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects/epidemiology; Fetus; Health Facilities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the impact of antiretroviral (ARV) regimen and maternal CD4+ count on HIV transmission within the Tingathe program in Lilongwe, Malawi. METHODS: We reviewed clinical records of 1088 mother-infant pairs enrolled from March 2009 to March 2011 who completed follow-up to first DNA PCR. Eligibility for antiretroviral treatment (ART) was determined by CD4+ cell count (CD4+) for women not yet on ART. ART-eligible women initiated stavudine-lamivudine-nevirapine. Early ART was defined as ART for >/=14 weeks prior to delivery. For women ineligible for ART, optimal ARV prophylaxis was maternal AZT >/=6 weeks+sdNVP, and infant sdNVP+AZT for 1 week. HIV transmission rates were determined for ARV regimens, and factors associated with vertical transmission were identified using bivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Transmission rate at first PCR was 4.1%. Pairs receiving suboptimal ARV prophylaxis were more likely to transmit HIV (10.3%, 95% CI, 5.5-18.1%). ART was associated with reduced transmission (1.4%, 95% CI, 0.6-3.0%), with early ART associated with decreased transmission (no transmission), compared to all other treatment groups (p = 0.001). No association was detected between transmission and CD4+ categories (p = 0.337), trimester of pregnancy at enrollment (p = 0.100), or maternal age (p = 0.164). CONCLUSION: Low rates of MTCT of HIV are possible in resource-constrained settings under routine programmatic conditions.

Here we examine risk factors for these adverse pregnancy outcomes in a cohort of HIV-infected women in Zambia considering the impact of infant HIV status. METHODS: A total of 1229 HIV-infected pregnant women were enrolled (2001-2004) in Lusaka, Zambia and followed to pregnancy outcome. Live-born infants were tested for HIV by PCR at birth, 1 week and 5 weeks. Obstetric and neonatal data were collected after delivery and the rates of neonatal (<28 days) and early mortality (<70 days) were described using Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: The ratio of miscarriage and stillbirth per 100 live-births were 3.1 and 2.6, respectively. Higher maternal plasma viral load (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for each log10 increase in HIV RNA copies/ml = 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-3.27) and being symptomatic were associated with an increased risk of stillbirth (AOR = 3.19; 95% CI 1.46-6.97), and decreasing maternal CD4 count by 100 cells/mm3 with an increased risk of miscarriage (OR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.02-1.54). The neonatal mortality rate was 4.3 per 100 increasing to 6.3 by 70 days. Intrauterine HIV infection was not associated with neonatal morality but became associated with mortality through 70 days (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.76; 95% CI 1.25-6.08). Low birth weight and cessation of breastfeeding were significant risk factors for both neonatal and early mortality independent of infant HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: More advanced maternal HIV disease was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Excess neonatal mortality in HIV-infected women was not primarily explained by infant HIV infection but was strongly associated with low birth weight and prematurity. Intrauterine HIV infection contributed to mortality as early as 70 days of infant age. Interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes for HIV-infected women are needed to complement necessary therapeutic and prophylactic antiretroviral interventions.","2012-08","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","138","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted at two antenatal care clinics in Lusaka, Zambia.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong></p> <p>1435</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Stillbirth/*epidemiology; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Abortion, Spontaneous/*epidemiology/*etiology; HIV Infections/*complications; Infant, Newborn, Diseases/*mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adolescents are responsible for eleven percent of births worldwide and they face several pregnancy and childbirth related complications. However, in low-income countries like Ethiopia, there are limited researches conducted to investigate outcomes of adolescent pregnancy. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the adverse maternal outcomes of adolescent pregnancy in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 12 health facilities from seven districts in East Gojjam zone, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 418 adolescents (15-19 years old) and 836 adult women (20-34 years old) who attended randomly selected health facilities in East Gojjam zone were included. Data were collected starting from admission to the maternity ward for labor and delivery, and postnatal depression was measured at six weeks' postpartum period using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to account for the within subject correlation and assess the effect of different known factors that could influence the outcome of this study. RESULTS: A lower percentage of adolescent (58.4%) than adult (71.2%) women had their first antenatal care booking before 16 weeks of gestation. After adjusting for different confounding factors, the adverse outcome that was significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy was postpartum depression (AOR: 2.29; 95% CI, 1.42, 3.7, p-value = 0.001). Assisted vaginal delivery (AOR: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23, 0.86, p-value 0.016) and cesarean section (AOR: 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19, 0.97, p-value = 0.042) were significantly lower among adolescent women. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent pregnancy is associated with higher odds of postpartum depression, and lower odds to undergo cesarean section and assisted vaginal delivery than adult women. Perinatal care services should be more adolescent-friendly to ensure early diagnosis and treatment of postpartum depression. School and community-based awareness programs regarding use of contraception to prevent unwanted adolescent pregnancy, early antenatal care booking and adverse pregnancy outcomes of adolescent pregnancy and provision of psychosocial support are recommended.","2021","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e0257485","","9","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>East Gojjam Zone,</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities and communities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities of East Gojjam Zone, which is located in the Amhara region, Northwest Ethiopia.

This study aimed to study the incidence of MNM and quality of care at a district hospital in rural Rwanda by applying this approach. METHODS: A facility based, prospective cohort study conducted at a district hospital in rural Rwanda between June 2013 and December 2014. Subjects were followed from time of admission to discharge or death. RESULTS: In 3979 deliveries, 3827 singletons and 152 twins pairs were born. Among the 4131 neonates, there were 3994 live births and 137 stillbirths. Ninety-nine women suffered severe maternal outcome (SMO): 86 maternal near misses and 13 deaths. This adds up to a maternal near miss ratio of 21.5 per 1000 live births (95 % CI 17.3-26.5), a maternal mortality ratio of 325 per 100 000 live births (95 % CI 181-543) and a mortality index of 13.1 % (95 % CI 7.3-21.9). Hemorrhage (n = 49, 57 %) and hypertensive disorders (n = 27, 31.4 %) were the commonest MNM conditions. Eclampsia (n = 4/13; 30.7 %) was the leading cause of maternal mortality, while sepsis/peritonitis following cesarean section (n = 2/6; 33.3 %) had the highest mortality index. Seventy-seven out of 99 SMO cases (77.9 %) were referred from other facilities with critical conditions and 28 out of 99 SMO cases (28.3 %) were admitted into the Intensive Care Unit. Several indicators such as administration of oxytocin, magnesium sulfate and antibiotics were found to be suboptimal. CONCLUSIONS: MNM is common at district level in Rwanda.

However, perinatal women living with HIV in Tanzania have reported an even greater prevalence of depression (43-45%). The primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between maternal depression and infant malnutrition among women living with HIV. The design was a retrospective cohort study within the context of a randomised controlled trial among women living with HIV and their infants. Within this trial, 699 mother-child pairs were analysed for the present study. Although antenatal depression was not associated with infant malnutrition and post-natal depression was negatively associated [relative risk (RR = 0.80, P = 0.04], cumulative depression demonstrated a positive association with infant wasting (RR = 1.08, P < 0.01) and underweight (RR = 1.03, P < 0.01) after controlling for confounding factors. Variation in the association between depression and infant nutritional status was observed for episodic vs. chronic depression. These findings suggest that providing evidence-based services for persistent depression among women living with HIV may have an effect on infant malnutrition. In addition, other positive outcomes may be related to infant cognitive development as well as HIV disease prognosis and survival among women.","2016-07","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","603-13","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size : </strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>1078</p> </div>","C:\Users\leon.mbano\Zotero\storage\CQX8SQXU\Kaaya S et al. - 2016 - Association of maternal depression and infant nutr.pdf","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult; Male; Chronic Disease; Child, Preschool; Infant; Follow-Up Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Adolescent; Child Development; Tanzania/epidemiology; Multivariate Analysis; *antenatal; Cognition; *sub-Saharan Africa; *maternal depression; *HIV-positive; *infant malnutrition; *Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; *Nutritional Status; *post-natal; *prenatal; Depression/complications/*epidemiology; Evidence-Based Medicine; Growth Disorders/complications/*epidemiology; HIV Infections/complications/*epidemiology; Malnutrition/complications/*epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies generally support male involvement to promote PMTCT, but the nature and impact of that involvement is unclear and untested. Additionally, stigma, disclosure and intimate partner violence pose significant barriers to PMTCT uptake and retention in care, suggesting that male involvement may be 'necessary, but not sufficient' to reduce infant HIV incidence. This study expands on a successful United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported PMTCT couples intervention pilot study conducted in the Mpumalanga province, targeting HIV-positive pregnant women and their partners, the primary objective being to determine whether male partner involvement plus a behavioral intervention will significantly reduce infant HIV incidence. METHODS/DESIGN: The study follows a cluster randomized controlled design enrolling two cohorts of HIV-positive pregnant women recruited from 12 randomly assigned Community Health Centers (CHC) (six experimental, six control). The two cohorts will consist of women attending without their male partners (n = 720) and women attending with their male partners (n = 720 couples), in order to determine whether the influence of male participation itself, or combined with a behavioral PMTCT intervention, can significantly reduce infant HIV infection ante-, peri- and postnatally. DISCUSSION: It is our intention to significantly increase PMTCT participation from current levels (69%) in the Mpumalanga province to between 90 and 95% through engaging women and couples in a controlled, six session ante- and postnatal risk-reducing and PMTCT promotion intervention addressing barriers to PMTCT (such as stigma, disclosure, intimate partner violence, communication, infant feeding practices and safer conception) that prevent women and men from utilizing treatment opportunities available to them and their infants. Based upon the encouraging preliminary results from our pilot study, successful CHC adoption of the program could have major public health policy implications for containing the epidemic among the most vulnerable populations in rural South Africa: HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants.

It is also a key concern in Ethiopia where more than half of pregnancies occur shortly after preceding childbirth. Whether the interval between pregnancies has an effect on stillbirth or not is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of inter-pregnancy interval on stillbirth in urban South Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based prospective cohort study was conducted among 2578 pregnant women and followed until delivery. Baseline data were collected at the household level during registration and enrolment. End-line data were collected from hospitals during delivery. Exposed groups were pregnant women with inter-pregnancy intervals < 18 months and 18-23 months. Unexposed group contains women with inter-pregnancy intervals 24-60 months. A generalized linear model for binary outcome was applied, using R version 4.0.5 software. Relative risk (RR) was used to estimate the effect size with a 95% confidence level. Attributable fraction (AF) and population attributable fraction (PAF) were used to report the public health impact of exposure. RESULTS: The overall incidence of stillbirth was 15 per 1000 total births, (95% CI: 11, 20%). However, the incidence was varied across months of inter-pregnancy intervals; 30 (< 18 months), 8 (18-23 months) and 10 (24-60 months) per 1000 total births. The risk of stillbirth was nearly four times (ARR = 3.55, 95%CI: 1.64, 7.68) higher for women with inter-pregnancy interval < 18 months as compared to 24-60 months. This means, about 72% (AF = 72, 95%CI: 39, 87%) of stillbirth among the exposed group (inter-pregnancy interval < 18 months category) and 42% (PAF = 42, 95%CI: 23, 50%) of stillbirth in the study population were attributed to inter-pregnancy interval < 18 months. These could be prevented with an inter-pregnancy interval that is at least 18 months or longer. CONCLUSIONS: Inter-pregnancy interval under 18 months increases the risk of stillbirth in this population in urban South Ethiopia. Interventions targeting factors contributing to short inter-pregnancy intervals could help in reducing the risk of stillbirth. Improving contraceptive utilization in the community could be one of these interventions.","2021-12","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","847","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Hossana, Shone, Gimbichu, Jajura, Homecho.</p> <p><strong>Location type :</strong></p> <p>Community</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>C<span style=""color: black"">onducted in 5 urban settings within the Hadiya zone, Ethiopia.</span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">2578</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Urban Population; Stillbirth; Stillbirth/*epidemiology; Pregnant women; Ethiopia/epidemiology; *Birth Intervals; Cohort; Inter-pregnancy interval; Urban South Ethiopia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For optimal outcomes, women need to achieve HIVRNA suppression. We report 6-month HIVRNA suppression and HIV drug resistance in the PURE study. METHODS: PURE study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating 3 strategies for promoting uptake and retention; arm 1: Standard of Care, arm 2: Facility Peer Support, and arm 3: Community Peer support. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers were enrolled and followed according to Malawi ART guidelines. Dried blood spots for HIVRNA testing were collected at 6 months. Samples with ART failure (HIVRNA >/=1000 copies/ml) had resistance testing. We calculated odds ratios for ART failure using generalized estimating equations with a logit link and binomial distribution. RESULTS: We enrolled 1269 women across 21 sites in Southern and Central Malawi. Most enrolled while pregnant (86%) and were WHO stage 1 (95%). At 6 months, 950/1269 (75%) were retained; 833/950 (88%) had HIVRNA testing conducted, and 699/833 (84%) were suppressed. Among those with HIVRNA >/=1000 copies/ml with successful amplification (N = 55, 41% of all viral loads > 1000 copies/ml), confirmed HIV resistance was found in 35% (19/55), primarily to the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class of drugs. ART failure was associated with treatment default but not study arm, age, WHO stage, or breastfeeding status. CONCLUSIONS: Virologic suppression at 6 months was <90% target, but the observed confirmed resistance rates suggest that adherence support should be the primary approach for early failure in option B+.","2017-06","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","S149-S155","","","75 Suppl 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in 21 sites in Central and Southern Malawi</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Sample size : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1272</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Malawi/epidemiology; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Young Adult; Breast Feeding; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; Viral Load; *Maternal-Child Health Services; Cluster Analysis; HIV Infections/*drug therapy/prevention & control/transmission; Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use; Program Evaluation; *World Health Organization; Drug Resistance/*drug effects; Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*drug therapy/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe postpartum outcomes for women in the study who were randomized to continue or discontinue ART after delivery. METHODS: Women with pre-ART CD4+ cell counts >/=350 cells/mm(3) who started ART during pregnancy were randomized postpartum to continue or discontinue treatment. Women were enrolled from India, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The primary outcome was a composite of progression to AIDS-defining illness or death. Log-rank tests and Cox regression models assessed treatment effects. Incidence rates were calculated per 100 person-years. A post hoc analysis evaluated WHO Stage 2/3 events. All analyses were intent-to-treat. FINDINGS: 1611 women were enrolled (June 2011-October 2014) and 95% were breastfeeding. Median age at entry was 27 years, CD4+ count 728 cells/mm(3) and the majority of women were Black African (97%). After a median follow-up of 1.6 years, progression to AIDS-defining illness or death was rare and there was no significant difference between arms (HR: 0.55; 95%CI 0.14, 2.08, p = 0.37). WHO Stage 2/3 events were reduced with continued ART (HR: 0.60; 95%CI 0.39, 0.90, p = 0.01). The arms did not differ with respect to the rate of grade 2, 3, or 4 safety events (p = 0.61). INTERPRETATION: Serious clinical events were rare among predominately breastfeeding women with high CD4+ cell counts over 18 months after delivery.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Moshi, Tanzania. POPULATION: Pregnant women over the age of 18 who sought antenatal care at two health clinics in Moshi, and the children they were pregnant with, were assessed for inclusion in this study. METHODS: The women were interviewed twice during pregnancy and three times after birth, the final follow up taking place 2-3 years postpartum. Signs of postpartum depression were assessed approximately 40 days postpartum with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Child growth was assessed with anthropometric measurements at 2-3 years of age and expressed as mean z-scores. RESULTS: In all, 1128 mother-child pairs were followed throughout the duration of the study. In total, 12.2% of the mothers showed signs of postpartum depression. Adjusted mean height-for-age z-score (HAZ) was significantly lower at 2-3 years follow up for children of mothers with postpartum depression than for children of mothers without (difference in HAZ: -0.32, 95% CI-0.49 to -0.15). Adjusted mean weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) was significantly increased for the children exposed to postpartum depression (difference in WHZ: 0.21, 95% CI 0.02-0.40), whereas there was no significant difference in adjusted weight-for-age z-score (WAZ; difference in WAZ: -0.04, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.12).

Meta-analyses of low-dose aspirin to prevent pre-eclampsia suggest that the incidence of preterm birth might also be decreased, particularly if initiated before 16 weeks of gestation. METHODS: ASPIRIN was a randomised, multicountry, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) initiated between 6 weeks and 0 days of pregnancy, and 13 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy, in nulliparous women with an ultrasound confirming gestational age and a singleton viable pregnancy. Participants were enrolled at seven community sites in six countries (two sites in India and one site each in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan, and Zambia). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by site) to receive aspirin or placebo tablets of identical appearance, via a sequence generated centrally by the data coordinating centre at Research Triangle Institute International (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). Treatment was masked to research staff, health providers, and patients, and continued until 36 weeks and 7 days of gestation or delivery. The primary outcome of incidence of preterm birth, defined as the number of deliveries before 37 weeks' gestational age, was analysed in randomly assigned women with pregnancy outcomes at or after 20 weeks, according to a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) protocol. Analyses of our binary primary outcome involved a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by site, and generalised linear models to obtain relative risk (RR) estimates and associated confidence intervals. Serious adverse events were assessed in all women who received at least one dose of drug or placebo. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02409680, and the Clinical Trial Registry-India, CTRI/2016/05/006970. FINDINGS: From March 23, 2016 to June 30, 2018, 14 361 women were screened for inclusion and 11 976 women aged 14-40 years were randomly assigned to receive low-dose aspirin (5990 women) or placebo (5986 women). 5780 women in the aspirin group and 5764 in the placebo group were evaluable for the primary outcome. Preterm birth before 37 weeks occurred in 668 (11.6%) of the women who took aspirin and 754 (13.1%) of those who took placebo (RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.81 to 0.98], p=0.012). In women taking aspirin, we also observed significant reductions in perinatal mortality (0.86 [0.73-1.00], p=0.048), fetal loss (infant death after 16 weeks' gestation and before 7 days post partum; 0.86 [0.74-1.00], p=0.039), early preterm delivery (<34 weeks; 0.75 [0.61-0.93], p=0.039), and the incidence of women who delivered before 34 weeks with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (0.38 [0.17-0.85], p=0.015). Other adverse maternal and neonatal events were similar between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: In populations of nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies from low-income and middle-income countries, low-dose aspirin initiated between 6 weeks and 0 days of gestation and 13 weeks and 6 days of gestation resulted in a reduced incidence of preterm delivery before 37 weeks, and reduced perinatal mortality.

CONCLUSION: In Malawi, IPTp with azithromycin and monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has a modest, 3-5-year positive impact on child weight, mid-upper arm circumference and head circumference, but not on weight-for-height Z-score.","2019","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e0216536","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white""> </span></span></strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Names</span></span><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white""> </span></span></strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">not Specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type : </span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Communities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description : </span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Conducted in Malaw</span></span><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">i</span></span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Sample size : </span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">1320</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Male; Child, Preschool; Drug Combinations; Infant; Malawi; Follow-Up Studies; Child; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/prevention & control; Malaria/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage; Antimalarials/administration & dosage; Arm/*anatomy & histology; Azithromycin/*administration & dosage; Birth Weight/*drug effects; Head/*anatomy & histology; Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic/epidemiology/prevention & control; Pyrimethamine/*administration & dosage; Respiratory Tract Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Sulfadoxine/*administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data are predominantly from high-income countries and have methodological limitations, calling the findings into question. This research was designed to overcome these limitations and assess the relationships between pregnancy intention and miscarriage, stillbirth, low birthweight, neonatal death and postnatal depression in a low-income country. METHODS: The pregnancy intention of 4,244 pregnant women in Mchinji District, Malawi, was measured using the validated Chichewa version of the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP). Women were re-interviewed postnatally to assess pregnancy outcome. Postnatal depression was assessed using the WHO's Self-Reporting Questionnaire. Multivariable regressions were conducted, with the choice of confounders informed by a pre-existing conceptual epidemiological hierarchy. RESULTS: Planned pregnancies are associated with a reduced risk of any (adjusted RR 0.90 [95%CI 0.86, 0.95]) or high symptoms of depression (adjusted RR 0.76 [95%CI 0.63, 0.91]) compared to unplanned pregnancies in rural Malawi. There was no relationship between pregnancy intention and the composite measure of miscarriage, stillbirth, low birthweight and neonatal death. There was some evidence that greater pregnancy intention was associated with reduced adjusted risk of stillbirth (0.93 [95%CI 0.87, 1.00]). CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to use a psychometrically valid measure of pregnancy intention, and to do so antenatally. As pregnancy intention increases, the risk of postnatal depression and, possibly, stillbirth decreases. This suggests a new, clinical use for the LMUP; identifying women antenatally who are at risk of these adverse pregnancy outcomes.","2018","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e0205487","","10","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Banja la Mtsogolo', a Marie Stopes International Partner, </span></span></p> <p><strong>Location type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facility and communities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in Mchinji District, a rural district in Malawi</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">4,244</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Male; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Poverty; Malawi; Self Report; Stillbirth; Adolescent; Abortion, Spontaneous/*epidemiology; Perinatal Death; Depression, Postpartum/*epidemiology; Pregnancy Outcome/*psychology; Pregnancy, Unplanned/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Sierra Leone, maternal malnutrition is amongst the highest in the world, while maternal mortality is high at 1320/100,000 live births and stunting in under-five is 37.9%, ranked 110/132 worldwide. Maternal malnutrition has been associated with preterm birth, small-for-gestational age infants, and poor maternal outcomes. Infants born prematurely or small-for-gestational age experience higher mortality and are at risk for stunting and decreased cognitive performance. Nutritional interventions alone during pregnancy may not be as effective in the setting of increased inflammation from repeated infections. Interventions are needed to improve maternal outcomes and reduce stunting in this population. Methods/design: This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical effectiveness trial of an improved supplementary food plus anti-infective therapies compared to standard therapy in malnourished pregnant women. Pregnant women will be randomized to receive a low water activity, ready-to-use supplementary food plus five anti-infective interventions or the standard of care which is 3.5 kg corn/ soy blended flour with 350 mL vegetable oil every two weeks. The five anti-infective interventions are 1) insecticide-treated mosquito net at the time of enrollment into the study, 2) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine given every 4 weeks, beginning at enrollment or at 13 weeks' gestation, whichever is later, 3)azithromycin at a dose of 1 g given once at enrollment (after first trimester)and again during 28-34 weeks of gestation, 4)single dose 400 mg albendazole given in second trimester, and 5) testing and treatment for bacterial vaginosis at enrollment and again at 28-34 weeks of gestation. Treatment will be provided for the duration of the pregnancy. The primary outcome measure will be birth length. Secondary outcomes in the mothers will include rates of maternal weight gain and increase in mid-upper arm circumference, and time to maternal anthropometric recovery. Secondary outcomes in the infants will include birth weight, birth head circumference, and linear and ponderal growth. Discussion: Malnutrition remains a major problem in the developing world with lasting maternal and infant consequences. Maternal malnutrition has been associated with intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight (LBW), pre-term delivery and poor cognitive development. Nutritional interventions alone have not been successful in reducing stunting. By bundling nutritional and anti-infective interventions, we aim to reduce intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight in moderately malnourished pregnant women in Sierra Leone. If successful, this bundle can easily be implemented by governments or non-governmental organizations.

Our aim was to examine whether supplementation with multiple micronutrients (MMN) or small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements affects dental caries development or periodontal health in a rural Malawian population. The study was embedded in a controlled iLiNS-DYAD trial that enrolled 1391 pregnant women <20 gestation weeks. Women were provided with one daily iron-folic acid capsule (IFA), one capsule with 18 micronutrients (MMN) or one sachet of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) containing protein, carbohydrates, essential fatty acids and 21 micronutrients. Oral examination of 1024 participants was conducted and panoramic X-ray taken within 6 weeks after delivery. The supplement groups were similar at baseline in average socio-economic, nutritional and health status. At the end of the intervention, the prevalence of caries was 56.7%, 69.1% and 63.3% (P = 0.004), and periodontitis 34.9%, 29.8% and 31.2% (P = 0.338) in the IFA, MMN and LNS groups, respectively. Compared with the IFA group, women in the MMN group had 0.60 (0.18-1.02) and in the LNS group 0.59 (0.17-1.01) higher mean number of caries lesions. In the absence of baseline oral health data, firm conclusions on causality cannot be drawn. However, although not confirmatory, the findings are consistent with a possibility that provision of MMN or LNS may have increased the caries incidence in this target population. Because of the potential public health impacts, further research on the association between gestational nutrient interventions and oral health in low-income settings is needed.","2016-01","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","99-110","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Mangochi hospital, Malindi Hospital, Lingwena , Namwera health center</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in Mangochi district in southern Malawian.</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Sample size :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">1391</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Incidence; Malawi/epidemiology; Pregnancy; *Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Postpartum Period; pregnancy; Intention to Treat Analysis; *Rural Health; dental caries; Dental Caries/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology; Dietary Supplements/*adverse effects; Lost to Follow-Up; micronutrient; Micronutrients/*adverse effects; nutritional intervention; oral health; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; periodontal diseases; Periodontitis/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology; Pregnancy Complications/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology; Severity of Illness Index; Single-Blind Method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Malawi, low soil selenium and dietary intakes coupled with low plasma selenium concentrations in HIV infection could have negative consequences for the health of HIV-infected mothers and their exclusively breastfed infants. OBJECTIVE: We tested the effects of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) that contained 1.3 times the Recommended Dietary Allowance of sodium selenite and antiretroviral drugs (ARV) on maternal plasma and breast-milk selenium concentrations. DESIGN: HIV-infected Malawian mothers in the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals, and Nutrition study were randomly assigned at delivery to receive: LNS, ARV, LNS and ARV, or a control. In a subsample of 526 mothers and their uninfected infants, we measured plasma and breast-milk selenium concentrations at 2 or 6 (depending on the availability of infant samples) and 24 wk postpartum. RESULTS: Overall, mean (+/- SD) maternal (range: 81.2 +/- 20.4 to 86.2 +/- 19.9 mug/L) and infant (55.6 +/- 16.3 to 61.0 +/- 15.4 mug/L) plasma selenium concentrations increased, whereas breast-milk selenium concentrations declined (14.3 +/- 11.5 to 9.8 +/- 7.3 mug/L) from 2 or 6 to 24 wk postpartum (all P < 0.001). Compared with the highest baseline selenium tertile, low and middle tertiles were positively associated with a change in maternal plasma or breast-milk selenium from 2 or 6 to 24 wk postpartum (both P < 0.001). With the use of linear regression, we showed that LNS that contained selenium and ARV were not associated with changes in maternal plasma and breast-milk selenium, but maternal selenium concentrations were positively associated with infant plasma selenium at 2 or 6 and 24 wk postpartum (P < 0.001) regardless of the study arm. CONCLUSIONS: Selenite supplementation of HIV-infected Malawian women was not associated with a change in their plasma or breast-milk selenium concentrations.

Pregnancy doubles the risk of HIV acquisition further, and maternal HIV acquisition contributes significantly to the paediatric HIV burden. Little data on combination HIV prevention interventions during pregnancy and lactation are available. We measured HIV incidence amongst pregnant and postpartum women receiving a community-based combination HIV prevention intervention in a high HIV incidence setting in South Africa. METHODS: A cohort study that included HIV-uninfected pregnant women was performed. Lay community-based workers provided individualized HIV prevention counselling and performed three-monthly home and clinic-based individual and couples HIV testing. Male partners were referred for circumcision, sexually transmitted infections or HIV treatment as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox's regression were used to estimate HIV incidence and factors associated with HIV acquisition. RESULTS: The 1356 women included (median age 22.5 years) received 5289 HIV tests. Eleven new HIV infections were detected over 828.3 person-years (PY) of follow-up, with an HIV incidence rate of 1.33 infections/100 PY (95% CI: 0.74-2.40). Antenatally, the HIV incidence rate was 1.49 infections/100 PY (95% CI: 0.64-2.93) and postnatally the HIV incidence rate was 1.03 infections/100 PY (95% CI: 0.33-3.19). 53% of male partners received HIV testing and 66% of eligible partners received referral for circumcision. Women within known serodiscordant couples, and women with newly diagnosed HIV-infected partners, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 32.7 (95% CI: 3.8-282.2) and aHR = 126.4 (95% CI: 33.8-472.2) had substantially increased HIV acquisition, respectively. Women with circumcised partners had a reduced risk of incident HIV infection, aHR = 0.22 (95% CI: 0.03-1.86). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal HIV incidence was substantially lower than previous regional studies. Community-based combination HIV prevention interventions may reduce high maternal HIV incidence in resource-poor settings. Expanded roll-out of home-based couples HIV testing and initiating pre-exposure prophylaxis for pregnant women within serodiscordant couples is needed in Southern Africa.","2017","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e0181691","","7","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name : </strong>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type : </strong>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description : </strong><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted at an urban primary healthcare facility located north of Durban in the eThekwini district, South Africa.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size : </strong><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1356</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Male; Postpartum Period; South Africa/epidemiology; Adolescent; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Proportional Hazards Models; Circumcision, Male; Counseling; HIV Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/*prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global health","","2214-109X (Linking)","10.1016/S2214-109X(15)00038-8","","BACKGROUND: Both young and advanced maternal age is associated with adverse birth and child outcomes. Few studies have examined these associations in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and none have studied adult outcomes in the offspring. We aimed to examine both child and adult outcomes in five LMICs. METHODS: In this prospective study, we pooled data from COHORTS (Consortium for Health Orientated Research in Transitioning Societies)-a collaboration of five birth cohorts from LMICs (Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa), in which mothers were recruited before or during pregnancy, and the children followed up to adulthood. We examined associations between maternal age and offspring birthweight, gestational age at birth, height-for-age and weight-for-height Z scores in childhood, attained schooling, and adult height, body composition (body-mass index, waist circumference, fat, and lean mass), and cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose concentration), along with binary variables derived from these. Analyses were unadjusted and adjusted for maternal socioeconomic status, height and parity, and breastfeeding duration. FINDINGS: We obtained data for 22 188 mothers from the five cohorts, enrolment into which took place at various times between 1969 and 1989. Data for maternal age and at least one outcome were available for 19 403 offspring (87%). In unadjusted analyses, younger (</=19 years) and older (>/=35 years) maternal age were associated with lower birthweight, gestational age, child nutritional status, and schooling. After adjustment, associations with younger maternal age remained for low birthweight (odds ratio [OR] 1.18 (95% CI 1.02-1.36)], preterm birth (1.26 [1.03-1.53]), 2-year stunting (1.46 [1.25-1.70]), and failure to complete secondary schooling (1.38 [1.18-1.62]) compared with mothers aged 20-24 years. After adjustment, older maternal age remained associated with increased risk of preterm birth (OR 1.33 [95% CI 1.05-1.67]), but children of older mothers had less 2-year stunting (0.64 [0.54-0.77]) and failure to complete secondary schooling (0.59 [0.48-0.71]) than did those with mothers aged 20-24 years. Offspring of both younger and older mothers had higher adult fasting glucose concentrations (roughly 0.05 mmol/L). INTERPRETATION: Children of young mothers in LMICs are disadvantaged at birth and in childhood nutrition and schooling. Efforts to prevent early childbearing should be strengthened.

The aim of this research was to assess the maternal and newborn effects of GDM in resource limited settings. METHODS: A prospective cohort was implemented in the five referral hospitals of Amhara region. Data were collected using both primary data collection tool and reviewing the patients' charts. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the effects of GDM on the pregnancy outcomes, fractional regression was used to estimate the proportion of weight gain in the first 3 months, Poisson regression was used to identify the effects of GDM on the episodes of childhood infectious diseases, independent sample t-test was used to estimate the effects of GDM on the newborn serum zinc and vitamin D levels. RESULTS: A total of 3459 women were included with a response rate of 85.56%. Cesarean section rate among GDM mother was 40.3% and among GDM free mothers was 7.1%. In the first 3 months, the weight gains of infant born from GDM mothers were 53% higher than infant born from GDM free mothers. GDM increases the risk of infectious disease episodes by 4 folds. GDM decreases the neonatal serum zinc and vitamin D levels. CONCLUSION: GDM increases the maternal complications of pregnancy; GDM significantly depletes the newborn micronutrient levels and increase the episodes of infectious diseases during the infancy periods.","2022-02","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","89-95","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">The study was conducted in the five referral hospitals of the Amhara region in Ethiopia</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(80, 80, 80)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">3459</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *birth outcomes; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Cesarean Section; Infant; Ethiopia; *Diabetes, Gestational/diagnosis/epidemiology; *Diabetes; *Diabetes Mellitus; *Gestational; *Pregnancy-Induced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It affects more than 422 million people globally. In resource limited settings, the progression of gestational diabetes (GDM) to DM was not well investigated and this research work was conducted to estimate the incidence of DM after GDM and their predictors in resource limited settings. METHODS: A retrospective and prospective cohort studies were used from January 2010 until December 2019. The data were collected using patients chart review, interview and collecting blood sample. Initially, baseline data were collected from GDM and GDM free women and update data were collected every 3 month. Clinical nurses were used to extract the necessary data from medical charts and to collect the data using patient interview. Laboratory technologists were used to measure the blood glucose level of the study participants. The study was conducted in pregnant women presenting themselves in the referral hospitals of Amhara regional state. The sample size was calculated using Epi-info software. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the profile of study participants. Kaplan Meier survival curve and life-table were used to estimate the survivals of study participants. Incidence density was used to estimate the incidence of DM. Cox regression was used to identify the predictors DM. RESULTS: A total of 4892 women were followed giving for the response rate of 88.62%. The mean age of study participants at the start of the study was 28.34 years with standard deviation [SD] +/-7.48 years.

The objectives of this study were to: assess how protected postpartum women in the Mfantseman municipal were against pregnancy, based on their patterns of amenorrhoea and sexual abstinence; determine the timing of postpartum contraception in relation to amenorrhoea and sexual abstinence; and determine the predictors of postpartum contraceptive use. Methods: This was a prospective study carried out in the Mfantseman Municipality of the Central region of Ghana. Out of 1914 women attending antenatal clinic in the municipal within the study period, 1350 agreed to be part of the study to ascertain their postpartum fertility and contraceptive behaviours a year following delivery. These women were traced to their communities using telephone and house numbers provided and only 1003 of the women were finally traced and interviewed. The women were asked about their breastfeeding behaviour, postpartum sexual abstinence, duration of amenorrhoea and postpartum contraceptive use. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 29.9 +/- 6.5 years; adolescents constituted the least proportion (3.3%) of the women. More than half (54.1%) of the women had Middle, Junior secondary school or Junior high school education. Most (43.3%) of the women were married by means of traditional rites and more than half (51.4%) of them were petty traders. The mean durations of breastfeeding, amenorrhoea and sexual abstinence were 6.6 +/- 2.8 months, 7.8 +/- 3.8 months and 4.4 +/- 3.1 months respectively, whilst mean time of first contraceptive uptake was 3.5 +/- 2.7 months postpartum. The time to first use of modern contraceptive method during the postpartum period indicates that about 50% of the women had started use of modern contraceptive methods by 2.7 months postpartum, and occured 0.6 and 3.6 months before sexual relations and resumption of menses respectively. Occupation (likelihood ratio p = 0.013), area of residence (likelihood ratio p = 0.004), mode of delivery (likelihood ratio p < 0.001), breastfeeding (p = 0.024), period since delivery (p < 0.001), preferred number of children (p < 0.001) and parity (p < 0.001) were found to be predictors of postpartum contraceptive use. Conclusion: Postpartum women in the Mfantseman municipal who did not use contraceptives or delayed in the use of contraceptives after birth were least likely to be protected against pregnancy in the post partum period, whilst those who adopted postpartum family planning were likely to be better protected because they were likely to adopt it within the first three months after birth and before the onset of sexual relations and first menses. The predictors of postpartum contraceptive use were breastfeeding pattern, occupation, parity, preferred number of children, period since delivery, place of residence and mode of delivery.","2018","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","13","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Saltpond Hospital, Mankessim Health Centre, Anomabo Health Centre, Biriwa Health Centre.</span></span><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in the Mfantseman Municipal area of the Central Region of Ghana</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>1350</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Postpartum; Breastfeeding; Amenorrhoea; Contraceptive use; Sexual abstinence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Doctors clinically diagnosed and treated MIP and fever symptoms during prenatal health care. Child HIV status was determined via DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for HIV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) by the 6th week of life. RESULTS: Mean gestational age at enrolment was 22.2 weeks. During follow-up, 16.6% of mothers had at least one MIP diagnosis, 15.9% reported fever symptoms and 8.7% had both fever and MIP diagnosis. Eleven per cent of HIV-exposed infants were HIV-positive by 6 weeks. The RR of HIV MTCT was statistically similar for infants whose mothers were ever vs. never clinically diagnosed with MIP (RR 1.24; 95% CI 0.94-1.64), were diagnosed with one vs. no clinical MIP episodes (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.77-1.48) and had ever vs. never reported fever symptoms (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.78-1.38) in pregnancy. However, the HIV MTCT risk increased by 29% (95% CI 4-58%) per MIP episode. Infants of women with at least two vs. no MIP diagnoses were 2.1 times more likely to be HIV infected by 6 weeks old (95% CI 1.31-3.45). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical MIP diagnosis, but not fevers, in HIV-positive pregnant women was associated with an elevated risk of early HIV MTCT, suggesting that malaria prevention and treatment in pregnant HIV-positive women may enhance the effectiveness of HIV prevention in MTCT programmes in this setting. Future studies using a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of malaria are needed to confirm this association.","2014-05","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","276-85","","5","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location name : </strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffd40080"">Dar es Salaam</span></p> <p><strong>Location type : </strong></p> <p>Community/ City</p> <p><strong>Description : </strong></p> <p>Dar es Salaam, Tanzania</p> <p>Community</p> <p><strong>Sample size : </strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">2368&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Malaria/*epidemiology; Tanzania/epidemiology; Multivariate Analysis; malaria; numerical data; AIDS; coinfection; HIV Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission; HIV mother-to-child transmission; HIV-exposed infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/prevention & control/*statistics &; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/pathology/virology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In a cohort of mother-infant pairs, we compared delivery of routine services at ANC/L&D and C&T facilities in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo from 2010-2013, using methods accounting for competing risks (eg, death). Women could opt to receive interventions at 90 decentralized ANC/L&D sites, or 2 affiliated C&T centers. Additionally, we assessed decentralization's population-level impacts by comparing proportions of women and infants receiving interventions before (2009-2010) and after (2011-2013) decentralization. RESULTS: Among newly HIV-diagnosed women (N = 1482), the 14-week cumulative incidence of receiving the package of CD4 testing and zidovudine or antiretroviral therapy was less at ANC/L&D [66%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 63% to 69%] than at C&T (88%; 95% CI: 83% to 92%) sites (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.69). Delivery of cotrimoxazole and DNA polymerase chain reaction testing to HIV-exposed infants (N = 1182) was inferior at ANC/L&D sites (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.92); the 10-month cumulative incidence of the package at ANC/L&D sites was 89% (95% CI: 82% to 93%) versus 97% (95% CI: 93% to 99%) at C&T centers. Receipt of the pregnancy (20% of 1518, to 64% of 1405) and infant (16%-31%) packages improved post decentralization. CONCLUSIONS: Services were delivered less efficiently at ANC/L&D sites than C&T centers. Although access improved with decentralization, its potential cannot be realized without sufficient and sustained support.","2015-12","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e130-9","","4","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's HIV prevention, care, and treatment programs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), specifically in Kinshasa.

The World Health Organization currently recommends that pregnant women receive high-dose calcium supplementation (1500-2000 mg elemental calcium) for prevention of preeclampsia in populations with low dietary calcium intake. Trials of low-dose calcium supplementation (< 1000 mg elemental calcium/day) during pregnancy have also shown similar reductions in the risk of preeclampsia; however, no trials to date have directly compared low-dose to the standard high-dose calcium supplementation. Our objective is to assess the non-inferiority of low-dose as compared to standard high-dose calcium supplementation in pregnancy. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct two independent trials in Bangalore, India (n = 11,000 pregnancies), and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (n = 11,000 pregnancies). The trial designs are individually randomized, parallel group, quadruple-blind, non-inferiority trials of low-dose calcium supplementation (500 mg elemental calcium/day) as compared to standard high-dose calcium supplementation (1500 mg elemental calcium/day) among nulliparous pregnant women. Pregnant women will be enrolled in the trial before 20 weeks of gestation and will receive the randomized calcium regimen from randomization until the time of delivery. The co-primary outcomes are (i) preeclampsia and (ii) preterm birth; we will test non-inferiority of the primary outcomes for low-dose as compared to the standard high-dose supplementation regimen in each trial. The trials' secondary outcomes include gestational hypertension, severe features of preeclampsia, pregnancy-related death, third trimester severe anemia, fetal death, stillbirth, low birthweight, small-for-gestational age birth, and infant death. DISCUSSION: The trials will provide causal evidence on the non-inferiority of low-dose as compared to the standard high-dose supplementation in India and Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate whether direct supplementation of these micronutrients to HIV-exposed infants reduces mortality and morbidity. DESIGN: Infants born to HIV-infected women from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were randomly assigned to receive daily oral supplementation of multiple multivitamins (vitamin B complex and vitamins C and E) or placebo from age 6 wk for 24 mo. All-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and unscheduled clinic visits were recorded. Morbidities were recorded during monthly follow-up visits. All mothers received multiple micronutrients throughout the study. RESULTS: A total of 1193 infants were randomly assigned to receive micronutrients and 1194 to receive placebo. There were 138 child deaths in the multivitamin group and 124 deaths in the placebo group (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.44; P = 0.33). Hospitalizations (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.13; P = 0.23), unscheduled clinic visits (RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.10; P = 0.59), and maternal reports of diarrhea (RR: 0.97; 0.87, 1.10; P = 0.64) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Fever (P = 0.02) and vomiting (P = 0.007) were significantly lower in the multivitamin group.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could prevent HIV during pregnancy/postpartum; however, identifying women who would most benefit from PrEP in this period is challenging. Women may not perceive risk, may not know partner HIV status and partners may have external partners during this period. PrEP offer in pregnancy could be universal or risk guided. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The PrEP Implementation for Mothers in Antenatal Care (PrIMA) study is a cluster randomised trial that aims to determine the best model for PrEP implementation in pregnancy, among women attending public sector maternal child health clinics in Western Kenya (HIV prevalence >25%). Twenty clinics are randomised to either universal PrEP offer following standardised counselling ('Universal arm' 10 clinics) or risk screening with partner self-test option ('Targeted arm' 10 clinics). Four thousand women will be enrolled and followed through 9-month postpartum. The primary analysis will be intention to treat. Outcomes reflect the balance between HIV preventive effectiveness and avoiding unnecessary PrEP exposure to women at low risk and include: maternal HIV incidence, PrEP uptake, PrEP adherence, PrEP duration, 'appropriate' PrEP use (among women with objective evidence of potential risk), infant birth outcomes, infant growth and partner self-testing uptake. To better understand the feasibility and acceptability of the provision of PrEP in these settings, qualitative interviews and cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at Kenyatta National Hospital and the University of Washington. An external advisory panel monitors adverse and social harm events. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, presentations at local and international conferences to national and global policy makers, community and participants.

The effectiveness of the intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine strategy recommended by WHO is threatened by high levels of parasite resistance. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of two alternative strategies: intermittent screening with malaria rapid diagnostic tests and treatment of women who test positive with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. METHODS: We did this open-label, three-group, randomised controlled superiority trial at four sites in western Kenya with high malaria transmission and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. HIV-negative pregnant women between 16 and 32 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned (1:1:1), via computer-generated permuted-block randomisation (block sizes of three, six, and nine), to receive intermittent screening and treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, or intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Study participants, study clinic nurses, and the study coordinator were aware of treatment allocation, but allocation was concealed from study investigators, delivery unit nurses, and laboratory staff. The primary outcome was malaria infection at delivery, defined as a composite of peripheral or placental parasitaemia detected by placental histology, microscopy, or rapid diagnostic test. The primary analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01669941. FINDINGS: Between Aug 21, 2012, and June 19, 2014, we randomly assigned 1546 women to receive intermittent screening and treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n=515), intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n=516), or intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (n=515); 1368 (88%) women comprised the intention-to-treat population for the primary endpoint. Prevalence of malaria infection at delivery was lower in the intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group than in the intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine group (15 [3%] of 457 women vs 47 [10%] of 459 women; relative risk 0.32, 95% CI 0.18-0.56; p<0.0001), but not in the intermittent screening and treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group (57 [13%] of 452 women; 1.23, 0.86-1.77; p=0.26). Compared with intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was associated with a lower incidence of malaria infection during pregnancy (192.0 vs 54.4 events per 100 person-years; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.28, 95% CI 0.22-0.36; p<0.0001) and clinical malaria during pregnancy (37.9 vs 6.1 events; 0.16, 0.08-0.33; p<0.0001), whereas intermittent screening and treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was associated with a higher incidence of malaria infection (232.0 events; 1.21, 1.03-1.41; p=0.0177) and clinical malaria (53.4 events; 1.41, 1.00-1.98; p=0.0475). We recorded 303 maternal and infant serious adverse events, which were least frequent in the intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group. INTERPRETATION: At current levels of rapid diagnostic test sensitivity, intermittent screening and treatment is not a suitable alternative to intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in the context of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance and malaria transmission. However, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is a promising alternative drug to replace sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for intermittent preventive treatment. Future studies should investigate the efficacy, safety, operational feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.

Miscarriage is a challenging end point to ascertain and there is scarce information on its rate in low-income countries. The objective was to estimate the background rate and cumulative probability of miscarriage in rural western Kenya. DESIGN: This was a population-based prospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Women of childbearing age were followed prospectively to identify pregnancies and ascertain their outcomes in Siaya County, western Kenya. The cohort study was carried out in 33 adjacent villages under health and demographic surveillance. OUTCOME MEASURE: Miscarriage. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2013, among 5536 women of childbearing age, 1453 pregnancies were detected and 1134 were included in the analysis. The cumulative probability was 18.9%. The weekly miscarriage rate declined steadily with increasing gestation until approximately 20 weeks. Known risk factors for miscarriage such as maternal age, gravidity, occupation, household wealth and HIV infection were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of weekly miscarriage rates in a rural African setting in the context of high HIV and malaria prevalence. Future studies should consider the involvement of community health workers to identify the pregnancy cohort of early gestation for better data on the actual number of pregnancies and the assessment of miscarriage.","2016-04","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e011088","","4","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Siaya County</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Location Type :</span></span></strong><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Community</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Description :</span></span></strong><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in 33 adjacent villages under the Kenya Medical Research Institute-Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KEMRI-CDC) Health and Demographic Surveillance System area (KEMRI-CDC HDSS), </span></span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">in </span><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Siaya County, western Kenya.</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Sample size :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1453 pregnancies recruited Siaya County, western Kenya</span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Rural Population; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Prevalence; *Developing Countries; Socioeconomic Factors; Adolescent; Kenya/epidemiology; Kenya; Age Factors; Pregnancy Complications/epidemiology; sub-Saharan Africa; *Abortion, Spontaneous; Gravidity; HIV Infections/complications/epidemiology; Miscarriage; prospective cohort; rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, it continued to be an essential part of the third sustainable development goals to end preventable child deaths by 2030. With a rate of 33 per 1000 births, Ethiopia has the highest level of perinatal mortality in the world. Thus, determining the magnitude and identifying the determinants are very crucial for evidence-based interventions. A community-based longitudinal study was conducted in Southwest Ethiopia among 3474 pregnant women to estimate the magnitude of perinatal mortality. Then, a case-control study among 120 cases and 360 controls was conducted to identify the determinants of perinatal mortality. Data were collected by using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables having a significant association with perinatal mortality at p < 0.05. The perinatal mortality rate was 34.5 (95% CI: 28.9, 41.1) deaths per 1000 births. Attending >/=4 ANC visits (AOR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.91), having good knowledge on key danger signs (AOR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.75), and having a skilled attendant at birth (AOR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.61) were significantly associated with a reduction of perinatal mortality. Being a primipara (AOR = 3.38; 95% CI: 1.90, 6.00), twin births (AOR = 5.29; 95% CI: 1.46, 19.21), previous history of perinatal mortality (AOR = 3.33; 95% CI: 1.27, 8.72), and obstetric complication during labor (AOR = 4.27; 95% CI: 2.40, 7.59) significantly increased perinatal mortality. In conclusion, the magnitude of perinatal mortality in the study area was high as compared to the national target for 2020. Care during pregnancy and childbirth and conditions of pregnancy and labor were identified as determinants of perinatal mortality. Hence, interventions need to focus on increasing knowledge of danger signs and utilization of skilled maternity care. Special emphasis needs to be given to mothers with a previous history of perinatal mortality, twin pregnancies, and having obstetric complications.","2020","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","6859157","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Egypt","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Community</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted in Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia,</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>3474</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Male; Risk Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Logistic Models; Infant; Surveys and Questionnaires; *Perinatal Care; Case-Control Studies; Ethiopia/epidemiology; Parity; *Perinatal Mortality; Clinical Competence; Knowledge; Obstetric Labor Complications; Pregnancy, Twin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The World Health Organization recommends that women in high HIV prevalent settings repeat HIV testing in the third trimester, and at delivery or directly thereafter. The Western Cape Province (South Africa) prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) guidelines recommend a repeat maternal HIV test between 32 and 34 weeks gestation and at delivery in addition to testing at the first antenatal visit (ideally <20 weeks gestation). There are few published longitudinal studies on the uptake of initial and repeated maternal HIV testing programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to investigate the implementation of initial and repeat maternal HIV testing guidelines in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2016 we established an electronic PMTCT register that consolidated routine data from a primary healthcare facility and its secondary and tertiary referral sites in Cape Town. This provided a longitudinal record for each participant, from first antenatal visit to delivery. Utilizing these data, we conducted a retrospective analysis investigating the completeness of maternal HIV testing according to the PMTCT HIV testing guidelines in Cape Town, and predictors of complete testing, from 2014 to 2016. RESULTS: Among 8558 enrolled pregnant women, 7213 (84%) were not known to be HIV positive at their first visit and thus eligible for HIV testing; 91% of them received >/=1 HIV test during pregnancy/delivery. Testing at the first visit was 98% among the 85% of women who attended antenatal care. Among women eligible to receive all three recommended HIV tests, only 11% achieved all three tests. Delivery HIV testing completion among all women without an HIV-positive diagnosis was 23%. HIV prevalence at delivery was 21% and HIV incidence between first visit and delivery in those with >/=2 HIV tests was 0.2%. Women who enrolled after 2014 were more likely to receive the three recommended tests (aOR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.81) and retest at delivery (aOR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.39). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of maternal HIV testing in Cape Town improved between 2014 and 2016 but major gaps remain, particularly at delivery.","2020-01","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e25441","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Mitchells Plain/Mitchells Plain Sub-Structure, Mitchells Plain Midwife Obstetric Unit (MPMOU), MPMOU, ,Mitchells Plain District Hospital (MPDH), Mowbray Maternity Hospital (MMH), Groote Schuur Hospital (GSH).</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted within the Western Cape province of South Africa, specifically focusing on the Mitchells Plain/Mitchells Plain Sub-Structure.

We evaluated the association between consumption of the amino acid arginine and the rate of adverse birth outcomes using data from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled micronutrient supplementation trial among pregnant women in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (2001-2004). Dietary intakes of arginine were assessed using repeated 24-hour recalls that were administered throughout pregnancy. Participants (n = 7,591) were monitored by research midwives throughout follow-up to assess pregnancy outcomes. Cubic-restricted splines and multivariable log-Poisson regression with empirical standard errors were used to estimate the continuous and categorical associations between arginine intake and adverse birth outcomes. Compared with women within the lowest quintile of arginine intake, those within the highest quintile had 0.79 times the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (95% confidence interval: 0.63, 1.00; P = 0.03). The continuous associations of arginine intake with preterm birth before 37 weeks and with preterm birth before 34 weeks were characterized by an initial rapid decrease in risk with increasing intake (P for nonlinearity < 0.01). Arginine intake was not associated with fetal loss or giving birth to infants who were born small for their gestational ages. This data suggest that the association between dietary arginine intake and preterm birth warrants further investigation.","2017-09","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","603-611","","5","186","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities (antenatal clinics)</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">7,591</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Pregnancy Outcome/*epidemiology; Tanzania; Tanzania/epidemiology; birth outcomes; pregnancy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Premature Birth/*epidemiology/prevention & control; *Diet; arginine; Arginine/administration & dosage/*physiology; Dietary Supplements/statistics & numerical data; Micronutrients/administration & dosage/physiology; nutrition; Poisson Distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Access to antenatal care is limited and the quality of services is poor in much of the country. Previous research in Bauchi State found associations between maternal morbidity and domestic violence, heavy work in pregnancy, lack of knowledge about danger signs, and lack of spousal communication about pregnancy and childbirth. This cluster randomized controlled stepped-wedge trial will test the impact of universal home visits to pregnant women and their partners, and the added value of video edutainment. METHODS: The trial will take place in six wards of Toro Local Government Area in Bauchi State, Nigeria, randomly allocated into three waves of two wards each. Home visits will begin in wave 1 wards immediately; in wave 2 wards after one year; and in wave 3 wards after a further year. In each wave, one ward, randomly allocated, will receive video edutainment during the home visits. Female home visitors will contact all households in their catchment areas of about 300 households, register all pregnant women, and visit them every two months during pregnancy, after delivery and one year later. They will use android handsets to collect information on pregnancy progress, send this to a central server, and discuss with the women the evidence about household factors associated with higher maternal risks, using video clips in the edutainment wards. Male home visitors will contact the partners of the pregnant women and discuss with them the same evidence. We will compare outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 wards at about one year, between wave 2 and wave 3 wards at about two years, and finally between wards with and without added edutainment. Primary outcomes will be complications in pregnancy and delivery, and child health at one year. Secondary outcomes include knowledge and attitudes, use of health services, knowledge of danger signs, and household care of pregnant women. DISCUSSION: Demonstrating an impact of home visits and understanding potential mechanisms could have important implications for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality in other settings with poor access to quality antenatal care services.

We compared pregnancy outcomes among HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) and with CD4 >/=350 cells, and HIV-uninfected women to assess whether disparities associated with HIV infection have been eliminated through use of ART. SETTING: Observational study conducted at 5 health facilities in Blantyre, Malawi, during 2016-2017. METHODS: HIV-infected women receiving the national ART regimen (efavirenz + lamivudine + tenofovir) and HIV-uninfected women were consented and enrolled at delivery. Data collected included sociodemographic and clinical; gestational age; BW; infant/maternal anthropometry; and laboratory results. We defined PTB as GA <37 weeks; LBW as BW <2.5 kg; and SGA as BW <10th percentile of GA. SGA infants were classified into proportionate and disproportionate based on ponderal index. Descriptive, stratified, and multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were used. RESULTS: Of 5423 women approached, 614 HIV-infected and 685 HIV-uninfected women were enrolled. Rates of PTB, LBW, and SGA were 10.6%, 7.2%, and 17.1% among HIV-infected women on ART and 9.5%, 5.0%, and 18.4% among HIV-uninfected women, respectively. None of these differences were statistically significant in univariate- or multivariate-adjusted analyses (P > 0.05). Of 231 SGA infants, 78.8% were proportionate and 21% were disproportionate. Of the 614 HIV-infected women on ART, 75% had undetectable virus at delivery. CONCLUSIONS: ART use has reduced the high rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes among HIV-infected women. However, the rates remain high irrespective of HIV infection and require appropriate interventions.","2019-01","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","7-14","","1","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital &nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in Blantyre, Malawi.

Global health","","2214-109X (Linking)","10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00175-3","","BACKGROUND: Secondary distribution of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits by patients attending clinic services to their partners could improve the rate of HIV diagnosis. We aimed to investigate whether secondary administration of HIVST kits, with or without an additional financial incentive, via women receiving antenatal care (ANC) or via people newly diagnosed with HIV (ie, index patients) could improve the proportion of male partners tested or the number of people newly diagnosed with HIV. METHODS: We did a three-arm, open-label, pragmatic, cluster-randomised trial of 27 health centres (clusters), eligible if they were a government primary health centre providing ANC, HIV testing, and ART services, across four districts of Malawi. We recruited women (aged >/=18 years) attending their first ANC visit and whose male partner was available, not already taking ART, and not already tested for HIV during this pregnancy (ANC cohort), and people (aged >/=18 years) with newly diagnosed HIV during routine clinic HIV testing who had at least one sexual contact not already known to be HIV-positive (index cohort). Centres were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using a public selection of computer-generated random allocations, to enhanced standard of care (including an invitation for partners to attend HIV testing services), HIVST only, or HIVST plus a US$10 financial incentive for retesting. The primary outcome for the ANC cohort was the proportion of male partners reportedly tested, as ascertained by interview with women in this cohort at day 28. The primary outcome for the index cohort was the geometric mean number of new HIV-positive people identified per facility within 28 days of enrolment, as measured by observed HIV test results. Cluster-level summaries compared intervention with standard of care by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03705611. FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2018, and May 2, 2019, nine clusters were assigned to each trial arm, resulting in 4544 eligible women in the ANC cohort (1447 [31.8%] in the standard care group, 1465 [32.2%] in the HIVST only group, and 1632 [35.9%] in HIVST plus financial incentive group) and 708 eligible patients in the index cohort (234 [33.1%] in the standard care group, 169 [23.9%] in the HIVST only group, and 305 [42.9%] in the HIVST plus financial incentive group). 4461 (98.2%) of 4544 eligible women in the ANC cohort and 645 (91.1%) of 708 eligible patients in the index cohort were recruited, of whom 3378 (75.7%) in the ANC cohort and 439 (68.1%) in the index cohort were interviewed after 28 days. In the ANC cohort, the mean proportion of reported partner testing per cluster was 35.0% (SD 10.0) in the standard care group, 73.0% in HIVST only group (13.1, adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.48-1.98; p<0.0001), and 65.2% in the HIVST plus financial incentive group (11.6, adjusted RR 1.62, 1.45-1.81; p<0.0001). In the index cohort, the geometric mean number of new HIV-positive sexual partners per cluster was 1.35 (SD 1.62) for the standard care group, 1.91 (1.78) for the HIVST only group (incidence rate ratio adjusted for number eligible as an offset in the negative binomial model 1.65, 95% CI 0.49-5.55; p=0.3370), and 3.20 (3.81) for the HIVST plus financial incentive group (3.11, 0.99-9.77; p=0.0440). Four self-resolving, temporary marital separations occurred due to disagreement in couples regarding HIV self-test kits. INTERPRETATION: Although administration of HIVST kits in the ANC cohort, even when offered alongside a financial incentive, did not identify significantly more male patients with HIV than did standard care, out-of-clinic options for HIV testing appear more acceptable to many male partners of women with HIV, increasing test uptake. Viewed in the current context, this approach might allow continuation of services despite COVID-19-related lockdowns.

Measurement of linkage to post-test services following HIVST remains the biggest challenge, yet is the biggest driver of cost-effectiveness. We investigated the impact of HIVST alone or with additional interventions on the uptake of testing and linkage to care or prevention among male partners of antenatal care clinic attendees in a novel adaptive trial. METHODS AND FINDINGS: An adaptive multi-arm, 2-stage cluster randomised trial was conducted between 8 August 2016 and 30 June 2017, with antenatal care clinic (ANC) days (i.e., clusters of women attending on a single day) as the unit of randomisation. Recruitment was from Ndirande, Bangwe, and Zingwangwa primary health clinics in urban Blantyre, Malawi. Women attending an ANC for the first time for their current pregnancy (regardless of trimester), 18 years and older, with a primary male partner not known to be on ART were enrolled in the trial after giving consent. Randomisation was to either the standard of care (SOC; with a clinic invitation letter to the male partner) or 1 of 5 intervention arms: the first arm provided women with 2 HIVST kits for their partners; the second and third arms provided 2 HIVST kits along with a conditional fixed financial incentive of $3 or $10; the fourth arm provided 2 HIVST kits and a 10% chance of receiving $30 in a lottery; and the fifth arm provided 2 HIVST kits and a phone call reminder for the women's partners. The primary outcome was the proportion of male partners who were reported to have tested for HIV and linked into care or prevention within 28 days, with referral for antiretroviral therapy (ART) or circumcision accordingly. Women were interviewed at 28 days about partner testing and adverse events. Cluster-level summaries compared each intervention versus SOC using eligible women as the denominator (intention-to-treat). Risk ratios were adjusted for male partner testing history and recruitment clinic. A total of 2,349/3,137 (74.9%) women participated (71 ANC days), with a mean age of 24.8 years (SD: 5.4). The majority (2,201/2,233; 98.6%) of women were married, 254/2,107 (12.3%) were unable to read and write, and 1,505/2,247 (67.0%) were not employed. The mean age for male partners was 29.6 years (SD: 7.5), only 88/2,200 (4.0%) were unemployed, and 966/2,210 (43.7%) had never tested for HIV before. Women in the SOC arm reported that 17.4% (71/408) of their partners tested for HIV, whereas a much higher proportion of partners were reported to have tested for HIV in all intervention arms (87.0%-95.4%, p < 0.001 in all 5 intervention arms). As compared with those who tested in the SOC arm (geometric mean 13.0%), higher proportions of partners met the primary endpoint in the HIVST + $3 (geometric mean 40.9%, adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 3.01 [95% CI 1.63-5.57], p < 0.001), HIVST + $10 (51.7%, aRR 3.72 [95% CI 1.85-7.48], p < 0.001), and phone reminder (22.3%, aRR 1.58 [95% CI 1.07-2.33], p = 0.021) arms. In contrast, there was no significant increase in partners meeting the primary endpoint in the HIVST alone (geometric mean 17.5%, aRR 1.45 [95% CI 0.99-2.13], p = 0.130) or lottery (18.6%, aRR 1.43 [95% CI 0.96-2.13], p = 0.211) arms. The lottery arm was dropped at interim analysis. Overall, 46 male partners were confirmed to be HIV positive, 42 (91.3%) of whom initiated ART within 28 days; 222 tested HIV negative and were not already circumcised, of whom 135 (60.8%) were circumcised as part of the trial. No serious adverse events were reported. Costs per male partner who attended the clinic with a confirmed HIV test result were $23.73 and $28.08 for the HIVST + $3 and HIVST + $10 arms, respectively. Notable limitations of the trial included the relatively small number of clusters randomised to each arm, proxy reporting of the male partner testing outcome, and being unable to evaluate retention in care.

The objectives of the Hlabisa pregnancy cohort are to: (1) provide cohort-level information on maternal health up to 6 weeks postpartum in a high HIV prevalence setting; and to (2) evaluate aspects of PMTCT care that have policy relevance. PARTICIPANTS: The pregnancy cohort is located in primary health clinics in the Hlabisa subdistrict of rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Baseline data collection between 2010 and 2014 has been completed with the enrolment of 25 608 pregnancies; age ranged from 15-49 years. Pregnant women were assessed during routine antenatal visits: first visit, follow-up 1 week later, 32 weeks (HIV test), infant delivery and 6 weeks postpartum. Demographic, pregnancy, clinical, laboratory and HIV data were collected through Department of Health interviews, laboratory tests and routine data linkage. Treatment data for HIV-infected pregnant women were linked to the Africa Centre Hlabisa HIV Treatment and Care Programme for detailed antiretroviral therapy (ART) history and laboratory tests. FINDINGS TO DATE: The proportion of women initiated on ART post-2013 were higher (n=437; 100%) than pre-2013 (n=768; 84.2%). The proportion of women in care at 6 weeks (73.8%) was also higher post-2013 relative to earlier years (58.5%). The majority of HIV-infected pregnant women were either on lifelong ART or ART prophylaxis; pre-2013, approximately 9.6% of women were not on any ART. Pregnancy viral load monitoring was inadequate. FUTURE PLANS: This cohort will be used to: (1) determine HIV acquisition risk during pregnancy and postpartum; (2) determine the effect of HIV and ART on birth outcomes; (3) examine the effect of pregnancy on virological response to ART; and (4) characterise the effect of sequential pregnancies on access to clinical care, response to prolonged ART and birth outcomes.","2016-10","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e012088","","10","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong> </p> <p>there are 17 health facilities in this district.</p> <p><img alt="""" data-attachment-key=""I9PI3G95"" width=""1280"" height=""1065""></p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong> </p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>: </strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted in the predominantly rural Hlabisa subdistrict of uMkhanyakude in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong> </p> <p>26 520</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; Postpartum Period; South Africa/epidemiology; Rural Population; Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use; control; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data; *antiretroviral therapy; *Guideline Adherence; *pregnancy cohort; HIV Infections/drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention &","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: Almost all pregnant mothers in 24 Cape Town neighborhoods were recruited into a cluster randomized controlled trial matched by neighborhoods to the Philani home-visiting condition (HVC) or the standard care condition (SC). At 3 years after birth, the quality of mother-child interactions between HVC and SC mothers with and without antenatal depressed mood was assessed in a representative subset by rating videotaped observations of mother-child interactions on 10 dimensions of caregiving. RESULTS: As predicted, maternal depressed mood at birth moderated the effect of the HVC on the quality of mother-child interactions. Among nondepressed mothers, mothers and their children in the HVC scored significantly higher on 5 of the 10 dimensions of the maternal-child interaction scale than mothers in the SC: mothers exhibited more maternal sensitivity, talked more, had more harmonious interactions, and had children who paid more attention and exhibited more positive affect. However, being in the HVC did not significantly affect the mother-child interaction scores among mothers with depressed mood. Among HVC children, those with mothers with depressed mood showed significantly less positive affect and talked less with their mothers than children with nondepressed mothers. SC children with mothers with depressed mood were more responsive and paid attention to their mothers than children with nondepressed mothers. CONCLUSION: Home visiting resulted in a better quality of caregiving for mothers without depressive symptoms. Future interventions need to specifically target maternal depression and positive mother-child interactions.

Reducing the burden of these infections in pregnancy requires interventions that can be easily integrated into the antenatal care (ANC) package. However, efforts to integrate the control of malarial infection and curable STIs/RTIs in pregnancy have been hampered by a lack of evidence related to their coinfection. Thus, we investigated the prevalence of coinfection among pregnant women of rural Zambia. A prospective cohort study was conducted in Nchelenge District, Zambia, involving 1,086 first ANC attendees. We screened participants for peripheral malarial infection and curable STIs/RTIs (syphilis, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis), and collected relevant sociodemographic data at booking. Factors associated with malarial and STI/RTI coinfection were explored using univariate and multivariate regression models. Among participants with complete results (N = 1,071), 38.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 35.7-41.6) were coinfected with malaria parasites and at least one STI/RTI; 18.9% (95% CI = 16.5-21.2) were infected with malaria parasites only; 26.0% (95% CI = 23.5-28.8) were infected with at least one STI/RTI but no malaria parasites, and 16.4% (95% CI = 14.1-18.6) had no infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women had a higher risk of being coinfected than HIV-uninfected women (odds ratio [OR] = 3.59 [95% CI = 1.73-7.48], P < 0.001). The prevalence of malarial and STI/RTI coinfection was high in this population. An integrated approach to control malarial infection and STIs/RTIs is needed to reduce this dual burden in pregnancy.","2016-11","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","1069-1076","","5","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Catchment area for two health centers, Nchelenge and Kashikishi</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities and communities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in the catchment area for two health centers, Nchelenge and Kashikishi, in Nchelenge District, located on the shores of Lake Mweru, northern Zambia.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p>1086</p> </div>","C:\Users\leon.mbano\Zotero\storage\KAMNX358\Chaponda EB et al. - 2016 - Malarial Infection and Curable Sexually Transmitte.pdf","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Rural Population; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Prevalence; Coinfection/diagnosis/*epidemiology/parasitology; Follow-Up Studies; Malaria/*epidemiology; Pregnancy Outcome; Reproductive Tract Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/parasitology; Sexually Transmitted Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/parasitology; Socioeconomic Factors; Trichomonas Infections/epidemiology; Vaginosis, Bacterial/epidemiology/parasitology; Zambia/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: This study compared maternal and offspring anthropometry for moderately malnourished pregnant women receiving ready-to-use supplemental food (RUSF), a fortified corn-soy blend (CSB+) with a daily multiple micronutrient antenatal supplement [United Nations International Multiple Micronutrient Preparation (UNIMMAP)], or standard of care comprising CSB+ and iron and folic acid (IFA). Design: A single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in southern Malawi among 1828 pregnant women with moderate malnutrition, defined as a midupper arm circumference (MUAC) >/=20.6 and </=23.0 cm. Women received 1 of 3 dietary treatment regimens that provided approximately 900 kcal/d and 33-36 g protein/d. Maternal and infant anthropometry were followed until the child was 3 mo old. Results: Newborns had a mean length-for-age z score of -1.3 +/- 1.2 and 22% were stunted at birth. Mothers receiving RUSF had the highest weight gain during supplementation (3.4 +/- 2.6, 3.0 +/- 2.2, and 3.2 +/- 2.4 kg for the RUSF, CSB+ with UNIMMAP, and CSB+ with IFA groups, respectively; P = 0.03). Newborn birth weights and lengths were similar across intervention groups, but the incidence of newborns with a birth weight <2.4 kg (weight-for-age z score <-2) was higher in the CSB+ with UNIMMAP group than the other groups (17%, 18%, and 24% for the CSB+ with IFA, RUSF, and CSB+ with UNIMMAP groups, respectively; P = 0.02). At birth, HIV-exposed newborns had a similar length and weight as newborns without HIV exposure, but their head circumference was smaller (34.0 +/- 1.5 and 34.3 +/- 1.6 cm, respectively; P = 0.02). At 3 mo of age, HIV-exposed infants had smaller weights, lengths, and head and arm circumferences than infants without HIV exposure. Conclusions: RUSF improved maternal weight gain compared with CSB+ with UNIMMAP. The large amount of food given and the modest effect on linear growth in newborns suggests that stunting in utero is unlikely to be reduced by supplemental food alone.

Total births, both stillbirths and live births, are often not counted, yet such data are critical to allocate resources and target interventions to improve survival. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and medically vulnerable phenotypes, such as preterm births, small-for-gestational-age (SGA), large-for-gestational-age (LGA), and low-birth-weight (LBW) births, in a setting where these key indicators remain largely unknown. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective pregnancy cohort study of women and their newborns was conducted between December 12, 2018, and November 5, 2020. The study was conducted in North Shewa Zone, Amhara, Ethiopia. Data were analyzed from July 2021 to May 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pregnancy status, gestational age, birth weight, and vital status were measured to estimate the prevalence of stillbirths, live births, and medically vulnerable live births (ie, preterm, SGA, LGA, and LBW births). For mortality outcomes, the prevalence of neonatal (overall, early, and late) and perinatal mortality were estimated. Results: Among the 2801 enrolled women, the median (IQR) age at conception was 26.5 (22.2-31.0) years, and the median (IQR) gestational age at enrollment was 24 (17-31) weeks. Of the 2628 women (93.8%) with outcome data, 101 pregnancies (3.8%) resulted in an early loss (<28 gestational weeks). Among the 2527 remaining pregnant women, there were 2518 births between 28 and less than 46 weeks' gestation; 2459 (97.7%; 95% CI, 97.0%-98.2%) were live births and 59 (2.3%; 95% CI, 1.8%-3.0%) were stillbirths. Many newborns (41.7%) were born preterm, SGA, LGA, or LBW. The estimated prevalence was 15.1% (95% CI, 13.7%-16.6%) for preterm births, 23.1% (95% CI, 21.3%-25.1%) for SGA births, 10.6% (95% CI, 9.3%-12.1%) for LGA births, and 9.4% (95% CI, 8.2%-10.8%) for LBW births. Among live births, the overall prevalence of neonatal mortality was 3.1% (95% CI, 2.5%-3.9%); mortality was higher among preterm births (7.2%; 95% CI, 4.9%-10.4%), LBW births (12.2%; 95% CI, 8.2%-17.7%), and SGA births (4.1%; 95% CI, 2.6%-6.5%). The prevalence of early neonatal mortality was almost twice as high as the prevalence of late neonatal mortality. The perinatal mortality prevalence was 4.3% (95% CI, 3.6%-5.2%), with a 1.2:1 ratio of stillbirths to first-week deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings have important implications for newborn health and survival. For policy makers and programmers, accurate data on key indicators of neonatal health provide information for resource allocation and to evaluate progress. For researchers, the findings underlie the importance for further research to develop and deliver interventions that improve health outcomes.","2022-06","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e2218534","","6","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location name : </strong></p> <p>Birhan field site</p> <p><strong>Location type : </strong></p> <p>Health facilities and communities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted at the Birhan field site, located in the North Shewa Zone, 130 km north of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>: </strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)"">2628</span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Infant Mortality; *Premature Birth/epidemiology; Stillbirth/epidemiology; *Perinatal Death; Ethiopia/epidemiology; Live Birth/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared FHR monitoring in labour using a novel, robust wind-up handheld Doppler with the Pinard as a primary screening tool for abnormal FHR on perinatal outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective equally randomised clinical trial. SETTING: The labour and delivery unit of a teaching hospital in Kampala, Uganda. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 2042 eligible antenatal women, 1971 women in active term labour, following uncomplicated pregnancies, were randomised to either the standard of care or not. INTERVENTION: Intermittent FHR monitoring using Doppler. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of FHR abnormality detection, intrapartum stillbirth and neonatal mortality prior to discharge. RESULTS: Age, parity, gestational age, mode of delivery and newborn weight were similar between study groups. In the Doppler group, there was a significantly higher rate of FHR abnormalities detected (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.61, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.30).

Since 2009, Global Network sites in six low and middle-income countries have collected information on antenatal care practices, which are important as indicators of care and have implications for programs to improve maternal and child health. We sought to: (1) describe the quantity of antenatal care attendance over a four-year period; and (2) explore the quality of coverage for selected preventative, screening, and birth preparedness components. METHODS: The Maternal Newborn Health Registry (MNHR) is a prospective, population-based birth and pregnancy outcomes registry in Global Network sites, including: Argentina, Guatemala, India (Belgaum and Nagpur), Kenya, Pakistan, and Zambia. MNHR data from these sites were prospectively collected from January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2013 and analyzed for indicators related to quantity and patterns of ANC and coverage of key elements of recommended focused antenatal care. Descriptive statistics were generated overall by global region (Africa, Asia, and Latin America), and for each individual site. RESULTS: Overall, 96% of women reported at least one antenatal care visit. Indian sites demonstrated the highest percentage of women who initiated antenatal care during the first trimester. Women from the Latin American and Indian sites reported the highest number of at least 4 visits. Overall, 88% of women received tetanus toxoid. Only about half of all women reported having been screened for syphilis (49%) or anemia (50%). Rates of HIV testing were above 95% in the Argentina, African, and Indian sites. The Pakistan site demonstrated relatively high rates for birth preparation, but for most other preventative and screening interventions, posted lower coverage rates as compared to other Global Network sites. CONCLUSIONS: Results from our large, prospective, population-based observational study contribute important insight into regional and site-specific patterns for antenatal care access and coverage.

We reanalyzed the first Beninese trial on mefloquine (MQ) versus SP for IPTp using a multiple outcome approach, which allowed the joint assessment of efficacy and tolerability. Overall superiority of MQ to SP was defined as superiority on at least one efficacy outcome (low birth weight [LBW], placental malaria, or maternal anemia), non-inferiority on all of them as well as on tolerability defined as cutaneous or neuropsychiatric adverse events (AEs) or low compliance with the treatment. The analysis included 1,601 women. MQ was found to be overall superior to SP (P = 0.004). Performing several sensitivity analyses to handle both missing data and stillbirths provided similar results. Using MQ for IPTp as an example, we show that a multiple outcome analysis is a pragmatic way to assess the benefits/disadvantages of one drug compared with another. In the current context of a lack of antimalarials that could be used for IPTp, such a statistical approach could be widely used by institutional policy makers for future recommendations regarding the prevention of malaria in pregnancy (MiP).","2015-08","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","300-4","","2","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities and community</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description:</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in southern Benin</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>1601</p> </div>","C:\Users\leon.mbano\Zotero\storage\J3R3YULP\Briand V et al. - 2015 - Mefloquine Versus Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine for In.pdf","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Drug Combinations; Treatment Outcome; Stillbirth; Antimalarials/*therapeutic use; Malaria/*prevention & control; Infant, Low Birth Weight/blood; Benin; Pyrimethamine/*therapeutic use; Sulfadoxine/*therapeutic use; Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic/*prevention & control; Mefloquine/*therapeutic use; Anemia/blood/parasitology; Placenta/parasitology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given that depression can undermine retention, it is important to understand how depression changes over the perinatal period, varies across treatment and retention groups, and could be buffered by social support. METHODS: Data are from an observational study conducted among women enrolled in Malawi's PMTCT Option B+ program. We used multilevel generalized linear models to estimate the odds of probable depression by time, treatment and retention group, and social support. Probable depression was assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Of 468 women, 15% reported probable depression at antenatal enrollment and prevalence differed across newly diagnosed individuals, second line therapy users, and previous defaulters (18%, 21%, 5%, p=0.001). Odds of probable perinatal depression decreased over time (OR per month: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.82-0.92) but were higher among those newly diagnosed (OR: 3.25, 95% CI: 1.59-6.65) and on second line therapy (OR: 3.39, 95% CI: 1.44-7.99) as compared to previous defaulters. Odds of probable postpartum depression were lower for participants with high social support (OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09-0.39). LIMITATIONS: Lack of diagnostic psychiatric evaluation precludes actual diagnosis of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Probable depression varied across the perinatal period and across treatment and retention groups. Social support was protective for postpartum depression among all participants. Depression screening and provision of social support should be considered in PMTCT programs.","2022-06","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","200-207","","","306","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : </span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type : </span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description : </span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Conducted in Lilongwe Malawi</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Sample size : </span></span></strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">8000</span></span></p> </div>","","","*HIV; eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Malawi/epidemiology; Pregnancy; Depression/epidemiology; *Perinatal depression; Social Support; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/prevention & control; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; *HIV Infections/epidemiology; *Depression, Postpartum/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology; *Social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Uganda Ministry of Health policy restricts management of second-trimester incomplete abortion to physicians who are few and unequally distributed, with most practicing in urban regions. Unsafe and outdated methods like sharp curettage are frequently used. Medical management of second-trimester post-abortion care by midwives offers an advantage given the difficulty in providing surgical management in low-income settings and current health worker shortages. The study aims to assess the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of treatment of incomplete second-trimester abortion using misoprostol provided by midwives compared with physicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled equivalence trial implemented at eight hospitals and health centers in Central Uganda will include 1192 eligible women with incomplete abortion of uterine size > 12 weeks up to 18 weeks. Each participant will be randomly assigned to undergo a clinical assessment and treatment by either a midwife (intervention arm) or a physician (control arm). Enrolled participants will receive 400 mug misoprostol administered sublingually every 3 h up to five doses within 24 h at the health facility until a complete abortion is confirmed. Women who do not achieve complete abortion within 24 h will undergo surgical uterine evacuation. Pre discharge, participants will receive contraceptive counseling and information on what to expect in terms of side effects and signs of complications, with follow-up 14 days later to assess secondary outcomes. Analyses will be by intention to treat. Background characteristics and outcomes will be presented using descriptive statistics. Differences between groups will be analyzed using risk difference (95% confidence interval) and equivalence established if this lies between the predefined range of - 5% and + 5%. Chi-square tests will be used for comparison of outcome and t tests used to compare mean values. P </= 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Our study will provide evidence to inform national and international policies, standard care guidelines and training program curricula on treatment of second-trimester incomplete abortion for improved access.

To improve perinatal survival, there is a need to understand the persisting risk factors for death. Objective: We determined the incidence, risk factors, and causes of perinatal death in Lira district, Northern Uganda. Methods: This was a community-based prospective cohort study among pregnant women in Lira district, Northern Uganda. Female community volunteers identified pregnant women in each household who were recruited at >/=28 weeks of gestation and followed until 50 days postpartum. Information on perinatal survival was gathered from participants within 24 hours after childbirth and at 7 days postpartum. The cause of death was ascertained using verbal autopsies. We used generalized estimating equations of the Poisson family to determine the risk factors for perinatal death. Results: Of the 1,877 women enrolled, the majority were </=30 years old (79.8%), married or cohabiting (91.3%), and had attained only a primary education (77.7%). There were 81 perinatal deaths among them, giving a perinatal mortality rate of 43/1,000 births [95% confidence interval (95% CI: 35, 53)], of these 37 were stillbirths (20 deaths/1,000 total births) and 44 were early neonatal deaths (23 deaths/1,000 live births). Birth asphyxia, respiratory failure, infections and intra-partum events were the major probable contributors to perinatal death. The risk factors for perinatal death were nulliparity at enrolment (adjusted IRR 2.7, [95% CI: 1.3, 5.6]) and maternal age >30 years (adjusted IRR 2.5, [95% CI: 1.1, 5.8]). Conclusion: The incidence of perinatal death in this region was higher than had previously been reported in Uganda. Risk factors for perinatal mortality were nulliparity and maternal age >30 years. Pregnant women in this region need improved access to care during pregnancy and childbirth.","2021-01","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","1859823","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Aromo, Agweng, &nbsp;Ogur</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Community</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in three sub-counties: Aromo, Agweng, and Ogur in Lira, a district in Northern Uganda.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong></p> <p>1877</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Uganda/epidemiology; Risk Factors; Infant Mortality; *Perinatal Death; *early neonatal deaths; *Perinatal death; *perinatal mortality; *risk factors; *Uganda","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to determine the hazard of pregnancy loss and related factors in the rural communities of Ethiopia. METHODOLOGY: A prospective community-based study was conducted over a period of 1 year. Pregnancy was identified as early as possible by a pregnancy urine test. All pregnant women identified during the screening were followed up at their home until termination of pregnancy or delivery of the neonate. The total follow-up time was 7802 'pregnant person months'. A Cox regression analysis was done to estimate the hazard of pregnancy loss. RESULT: Out of a total of 1438 terminated pregnancies, 143 (9.9%) did not end in live birth, 116 ended due to bleeding and 27 were stillbirths. Whilst the hazard of pregnancy loss was low among women with pregnancy interval of two or more years [AHR 0.3 (95%CI: 0.15, 0.43)], it was high among women having unplanned pregnancy [AHR 2.2 (95% CI: 1.56, 3.11)], among those who complained STI like symptoms during the index pregnancy [AHR 4.5 (95% CI: 2.79, 7.38)] and among those never received antenatal care [AHR 1.8 (95% CI: 1.13, 2.73)]. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy loss was higher amongst women experienced unplanned pregnancy, complained STI like symptoms and women who had not attended antenatal care services.

Sub-optimal uptake of the interventions may be due to inadequate active participation of pregnant women in their antenatal care. It was hypothesized that providing opportunities for pregnant women to improve upon active participation in their antenatal care through malaria and anaemia point-of-care testing would improve adherence to ANC recommendations and interventions and lead to better pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Fourteen antenatal clinics in the Ashanti region of Ghana were randomized into intervention (pregnant women participating in their care plus current routine care) and control (current routine care) arms. Pregnant women attending the clinics for the first time were recruited and followed up until delivery. Haemoglobin levels and malaria parasitaemia were measured at baseline, 4-8 weeks after recruitment and at 36-40 weeks gestation. Birth weight and pregnancy outcomes were also recorded. RESULTS: The overall mean age, gestational age and haemoglobin at baseline were 26.4 years, 17.3 weeks and 110 g/l, respectively, with no significant differences between groups; 10.7% had asymptomatic parasitaemia; 74.6% owned an ITN but only 48.8% slept under it the night before enrolment. The adjusted risk ratio by 8 weeks follow up and at 36-40 weeks gestation in the intervention versus the control was 0.97 (95% CI 0.78-1.22) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.63-1.34) for anaemia and 1.17 (95% CI 0.68-2.04) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.27-2.57) for parasitaemia. The adjusted risk ratio for low birth weight was 0.93 (95% CI 0.44-1.97) and for pregnancy complications (abortions, intrauterine fetal deaths and still births) was 0.77 (95% CI 0.17-3.52) in the intervention group versus controls. CONCLUSION: Although its potential was evident, this study found no significant beneficial effect of women participating in their malaria and haemoglobin tests on pregnancy outcomes. Exploring factors influencing health worker compliance to health intervention implementation and patient adherence to health interventions within this context will contribute in future to improving intervention effectiveness.

Evidence on interrelated mechanisms from a cohort study in Kenya.","BMJ open","","2044-6055 (Linking)","10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050670","","OBJECTIVES: To examine the determinants of the continuum of maternal care from an integrated perspective, focusing on how key components of an adequate journey are interrelated. DESIGN: A facility-based prospective cohort study. SETTING: 25 health facilities across three counties of Kenya: Nairobi, Kisumu and Kakamega. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5 879 low-income pregnant women aged 13-49 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Ordinary least squares, Poisson and logistic regression models were employed, to predict three key determinants of the continuum of maternal care: (i) the week of enrolment at the clinic for antenatal care (ANC), (ii) the total number of ANC visits and (iii) utilisation of skilled birth attendance (SBA). The interrelationship between the three outcome variables was assessed with structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Each week of delayed enrolment in ANC reduced the number of ANC visits by 3% (incidence rate ratio=0.967, 95% CI 0.965 to 0.969). A higher number of ANC visits increased the relative probability of using SBA (odds ratio=1.28, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.34). The direct association between late enrolment and SBA was positive (odds ratio=1.033, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.04). Predisposing factors (age, household head's education), enabling factors (wealth, shorter distance, rural area) and need factors (risk level of pregnancy, multigravida) were positively associated with adherence to ANC. CONCLUSION: The results point towards a domino-effect and underscore the importance of enhancing the full continuum of maternal care. A larger number of ANC visits increases SBA, while early initiation of the care journey increases the number of ANC visits, thereby indirectly supporting SBA as well. These beneficial pathways counteract the direct link between enrolment and SBA, which is partly driven by pregnant teenagers who both enrol late and are at heightened risk of complications, stressing the need for specific attention to this vulnerable population.","2022-01","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e050670","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location &nbsp;Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location &nbsp;Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facility</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>Conducted in 25 health facilities in three counties in Kenya: Nairobi, Kisumu, and Kakamega.

Fetal and neonatal edition","","1359-2998 (Linking)","10.1136/archdischild-2013-305877","","OBJECTIVE: Malawi has the highest estimated preterm birth rate in the world. The survival rate of these babies is not known. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the short-term survival of infants with birth weight below 2500 g nursed in Bwaila Hospital, a district hospital, and the tertiary level Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in Lilongwe. The specific objectives were to calculate birth weight specific survival rates, compare the two hospitals regarding the chances of survival and review the use of antenatal corticosteroids. DESIGN: 1496 babies were included prospectively in the study between June and November 2012. Survival was defined as discharge from the nursery or postnatal ward. RESULTS: Survival was 7% for extremely low birth weight infants, 52% for very low birth weight and 90% for low birth weight (1500-2499 g). There was a marked increase in survival from 1100 g. Survival was significantly higher in KCH only for babies weighing below 1200 g. The majority of deaths occurred within the first 3 days of life. Only 98 of the babies had a mother who had received antenatal corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: With the current resources, we suggest focusing efforts on preventing early neonatal deaths in low birth weight infants above 1100 g in the hospitals in Lilongwe. The coverage of antenatal steroids for mothers at risk of preterm delivery can be improved. Further studies are needed on the quality of the obstetric and neonatal care at the hospitals and how to reduce the high rate of preterm birth in Malawi.","2015-03","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","F150-4","","2","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: #ffd40080"">tertiary level KCH and BH hospitals</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Lilongwe, the capital of Malawi, there are two public hospitals: the tertiary level KCH and BH, a district hospital.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1496</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Malawi/epidemiology; Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Male; Infant; Adolescent; Infant Mortality; Prognosis; *Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Age Factors; Hospitals, Public; Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight; low birth weight; mortality; neonatology; Premature; Premature Birth/*mortality; survival; Survival Rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infectious diseases","","1473-3099 (Linking)","10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30523-0","","BACKGROUND: Pregnancy increases the risk of harmful effects from cholera for both mothers and their fetuses. A killed oral cholera vaccine, Shanchol (Shantha Biotechnics, Hydrabad, India), can protect against the disease for up to 5 years. However, cholera vaccination campaigns have often excluded pregnant women because of insufficient safety data for use during pregnancy. We did an observational cohort study to assess the safety of Shanchol during pregnancy. METHODS: This observational cohort study was done in two adjacent districts (Nsanje and Chikwawa) in Malawi. Individuals older than 1 year in Nsanje were offered oral cholera vaccine during a mass vaccination campaign between March 30 and April 30, 2015, but no vaccines were administered in Chikwawa. We enrolled women who were exposed to oral cholera vaccine during pregnancy in Nsanje district, and women who were pregnant in Chikwawa district (and thus not exposed to oral cholera vaccine) during the same period. The primary endpoint of our analysis was pregnancy loss (spontaneous miscarriage or stillbirth), and the secondary endpoints were neonatal deaths and malformations. We evaluated these endpoints using log-binomial regression, adjusting for the imbalanced baseline characteristics between the groups. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02499172. FINDINGS: We recruited 900 women exposed to oral cholera vaccine and 899 women not exposed to the vaccine between June 16 and Oct 10, 2015, and analysed 835 in each group. 361 women exposed to the vaccine and 327 not exposed to the vaccine were recruited after their pregnancies had ended. The incidence of pregnancy loss was 27.54 (95% CI 18.41-41.23) per 1000 pregnancies among those exposed to the vaccine and 21.56 (13.65-34.04) per 1000 among those not exposed. The adjusted relative risk for pregnancy loss among those exposed to oral cholera vaccine was 1.24 (95% CI 0.64-2.43; p=0.52) compared with those not exposed to the vaccine. The neonatal mortality rate was 11.78 (95% CI 5.92-23.46) per 1000 livebirths for infants whose mothers were exposed to oral cholera vaccine versus 8.91 (4.02-19.77) per 1000 livebirths for infants whose mothers were not exposed to the vaccine (crude relative risk 1.32, 95% CI 0.46-3.84; p=0.60). Only three newborn babies had malformations, two in the vaccine exposure group and one in the no-exposure group, yielding a relative risk of 2.00 (95% CI 0.18-22.04; p=0.57), although this estimate is unreliable because of the small number of outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides evidence that fetal exposure to oral cholera vaccine confers no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss, neonatal mortality, or malformation. These data, along with findings from two retrospective studies, support use of oral cholera vaccine in pregnant women in cholera-affected regions.

DESIGN: Secondary retrospective data analysis from two randomized intervention trials of mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention. METHODS: The Mashi and Mma Bana studies enrolled HIV-infected pregnant women, following their children through 24 months of age. This analysis includes singleton, full-term, HIV-exposed uninfected children. Mothers received cART or ZDV at least 2 weeks predelivery, and breastfed up to 6 months. Weight-for-age (WAZ), length-for-age (LAZ) and weight-for-length (WLZ) z-scores were derived. Mean z-scores were compared by exposure group at 24 months (t-test, linear regression). RESULTS: Of 819 children, 303 were ZDV- and 516 cART-exposed in utero. Maternal median enrolment CD4 was higher among ZDV versus cART-treated mothers (393 versus 324 cells/mul; P < 0.0001). Median duration of antepartum antiretroviral use was shorter among ZDV-treated women (5.7 versus 12.0 weeks; P < 0.0001). Median months breastfed were similar (5.9 and 6.0; P = 0.43). At 24 months, mean LAZ and WAZ were significantly lower among cART-exposed children (LAZ -1.01 versus -0.74; P = 0.003) (WAZ -0.53 versus -0.30; P = 0.002) in unadjusted analyses. Adjusting for maternal CD4, viral load, enrolment site and maternal anthropometric measures, cART-exposed children had significantly lower LAZ and WAZ at 24 months (P = 0.0004 for both). CONCLUSION: At 24 months, in-utero cART-exposed children had significantly lower LAZ and WAZ. Poor growth impacts childhood and adult mortality. These findings raise concerns for potential lasting health impacts among HIV-exposed uninfected children with in-utero cART exposure.","2016-01","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","211-20","","2","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted at four study sites in southern Botswana.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p>1200</p> </div>","C:\Users\leon.mbano\Zotero\storage\3QBPJDMQ\Powis KM et al. - 2016 - In-utero triple antiretroviral exposure associated.pdf","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Male; Child, Preschool; Infant; Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use; Anthropometry; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Body Weight; Botswana/epidemiology; *Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Body Height; Developmental Disabilities/*epidemiology/pathology; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*epidemiology/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global health","","2214-109X (Linking)","10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30385-1","","BACKGROUND: Modelled mortality estimates have been useful for health programmes in low-income and middle-income countries. However, these estimates are often based on sparse and low-quality data. We aimed to generate high quality data about the burden, timing, and causes of maternal deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study done in 11 community-based research sites in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, between July, 2012, and February, 2016, we conducted population-based surveillance of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) to identify pregnancies, which were followed up to birth and 42 days post partum. We used standard operating procedures, data collection instruments, training, and standardisation to harmonise study implementation across sites. Verbal autopsies were done for deaths of all women of reproductive age, neonatal deaths, and stillbirths. Physicians used standardised methods for cause of death assignment. Site-specific rates and proportions were pooled at the regional level using a meta-analysis approach. FINDINGS: We identified 278 186 pregnancies and 263 563 births across the study sites, with outcomes ascertained for 269 630 (96.9%) pregnancies, including 8761 (3.2%) that ended in miscarriage or abortion. Maternal mortality ratios in sub-Saharan Africa (351 per 100 000 livebirths, 95% CI 168-732) were similar to those in south Asia (336 per 100 000 livebirths, 247-458), with far greater variability within sites in sub-Saharan Africa. Stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates were approximately two times higher in sites in south Asia than in sub-Saharan Africa (stillbirths: 35.1 per 1000 births, 95% CI 28.5-43.1 vs 17.1 per 1000 births, 12.5-25.8; neonatal mortality: 43.0 per 1000 livebirths, 39.0-47.3 vs 20.1 per 1000 livebirths, 14.6-27.6). 40-45% of pregnancy-related deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths occurred during labour, delivery, and the 24 h postpartum period in both regions. Obstetric haemorrhage, non-obstetric complications, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and pregnancy-related infections accounted for more than three-quarters of maternal deaths and stillbirths. The most common causes of neonatal deaths were perinatal asphyxia (40%, 95% CI 39-42, in south Asia; 34%, 32-36, in sub-Saharan Africa) and severe neonatal infections (35%, 34-36, in south Asia; 37%, 34-39 in sub-Saharan Africa), followed by complications of preterm birth (19%, 18-20, in south Asia; 24%, 22-26 in sub-Saharan Africa). INTERPRETATION: These results will contribute to improved global estimates of rates, timing, and causes of maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths. Our findings imply that programmes in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia need to further intensify their efforts to reduce mortality rates, which continue to be high. The focus on improving the quality of maternal intrapartum care and immediate newborn care must be further enhanced. Efforts to address perinatal asphyxia and newborn infections, as well as preterm birth, are critical to achieving survival goals in the Sustainable Development Goals era.

HIV-positive women (N = 2369), between 12 and 32 weeks gestation were followed through delivery in Tanzania, from 2003 to 2008. Participants were women enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial who delivered live births. METHODS: Binomial regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of maternal nutritional indicators of MAMA, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), body mass index (BMI) and maternal weight with LBW, SGA and preterm in multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Higher MAMA was associated with a 32% lower risk of LBW compared to lower measurements (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.50-0.94). Similar protective associations were noted for higher BMI (RR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.42-0.79); maternal weight (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.36-0.69) and MUAC (RR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.45-0.86). Higher MAMA was also associated with lower risk of SGA (RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.68-0.90) and marginally associated with preterm (RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.69-1.04). Beneficial associations of MUAC, BMI and maternal weight with SGA and preterm were also observed. CONCLUSION: MAMA performs comparably to MUAC, maternal weight and BMI, as a predictor of LBW and SGA in HIV-infected women. The possible role of MAMA and other indicators in screening HIV positive women at risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes should be investigated.","2018-12","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","500","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>&nbsp;:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted at a single clinic in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">3500</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Gestational Age; Pregnancy Outcome; *Infant, Low Birth Weight; Tanzania; HIV; Women; Anthropometry; Nutrition Assessment; Body Mass Index; Low birth weight; Risk Assessment/methods; *Arm; *HIV Infections/complications/diagnosis; *Malnutrition/complications/diagnosis; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/diagnosis/virology; Anthropometry/*methods; Correlation of Data; Muscle area; Muscle, Skeletal/*pathology; Nutrition/wasting; Pregnancy outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines the association between prenatal factors, birth outcomes, and early life characteristics with motor, cognitive/language, and socioemotional development in Tanzania. METHODS: We assessed motor, cognitive/language, and socioemotional development among a cohort of 198 children aged 20-39 months in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, whose mothers were previously enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of prenatal vitamin A and zinc supplementation. Linear regression models were used to assess standardized mean differences in child development scores for randomized prenatal regimen and pregnancy, delivery, and early childhood factors. RESULTS: Children born to mothers randomized to prenatal vitamin A had significantly lower reported motor scores in minimally adjusted and multivariate analyses, -0.29 SD, 95% CI [-0.54, -0.04], p = 0.03, as compared with children whose mothers did not receive vitamin A. There was no significant effect of randomized prenatal zinc on any development domain. Greater caregiver-child stimulation was associated with 0.38 SD, 95% CI [0.14, 0.63], p < 0.01, better cognitive/language scores, whereas children who experienced both verbal and physical punishment had 0.29 SD, 95% CI [-0.52, -0.05], p = 0.02, lower scores in socioemotional development. Maternal completion of primary school was associated with higher reported motor and cognitive/language development. Further, children of mothers who were <155 cm tall had lower cognitive and language scores. CONCLUSION: Prenatal vitamin A supplements in a setting with low levels of vitamin A deficiency may not provide child development benefits. However, integrated environmental, educational, parenting, and stimulation interventions may have large positive effects across child development domains in resource-limited settings.","2018-11","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","841-849","","6","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facility</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> &nbsp;<strong>:</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in health facilities in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>2500</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Dietary Supplements; Male; Child, Preschool; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Tanzania/epidemiology; *child development; Health Surveys; *developing countries; *early assessment; *psychosocial factors; *randomized trials; Child Development/*physiology; Education, Nonprofessional/*organization & administration; Language Development; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/*physiology; Mothers/education/*psychology; Motor Skills/*physiology; Punishment/*psychology; Social Environment; Vitamin A/therapeutic use; Zinc/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We determined incidence and correlates of T. vaginalis in an HIV-uninfected peripartum cohort. METHODS: Women participating in a prospective study of peripartum HIV acquisition in Western Kenya were enrolled during pregnancy and followed until 9 months post partum. T. vaginalis was assessed every 1-3 months using wet mount microscopy. Correlates of incident T. vaginalis were determined using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Among 1271 women enrolled, median age was 22 years (IQR 19-27) and gestational age was 22 weeks (IQR 18-26); most (78%) were married and had uncircumcised male partners (69%). Prevalent T. vaginalis was detected in 81 women (6%) at enrolment. Among women without T. vaginalis at enrolment, 112 had T. vaginalis detected during 1079 person-years of follow-up (10.4 per 100 person-years). After adjustment for socio-economic factors, male partner circumcision status, pregnancy status and other STIs, T. vaginalis incidence was higher during pregnancy than post partum (22.3 vs 7.7 per 100 person-years, adjusted HR (aHR) 3.68, 95% CI 1.90 to 7.15, p<0.001). Women with circumcised male partners had a 58% lower risk of incident T. vaginalis compared with women with uncircumcised partners (aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.76, p=0.004). Employed women had lower risk of incident T. vaginalis than unemployed women (aHR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.79, p=0.003); recent STI was associated with increased T. vaginalis risk (aHR 2.97, 95% CI 1.49 to 5.94, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: T. vaginalis was relatively common in this peripartum cohort. Male circumcision may confer benefits in preventing T. vaginalis.","2017-03","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","137-143","","2","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>: </strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>Health facility</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>: </strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">The study was conducted in health facilities Western Kenya</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>: </strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1271</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Male; Prevalence; Postpartum Period; Kenya/epidemiology; *Sexual Partners; *EPIDEMIOLOGY (CLINICAL); *PREGNANCY; *TRICHOMONAS; *WOMEN; Circumcision, Male/*statistics & numerical data; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*epidemiology/*prevention & control; Trichomonas Infections/*epidemiology/*prevention & control; Trichomonas vaginalis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a post-hoc evaluation of HEU and HU cohorts, we examine growth patterns and clinical outcomes in the first 9 months of infancy in association with breastfeeding duration. METHODS: Two cohorts of infants, HEU and HU from a low-socioeconomic township in South Africa, were evaluated from birth until 9 months of age. Clinical, anthropometric and infant feeding data were analysed. Standard descriptive statistics and regression analysis were performed to determine the effect of HIV exposure and breastfeeding duration on growth and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Included in this secondary analysis were 123 HEU and 157 HU infants breastfed for a median of 26 and 14 weeks respectively. Median WLZ score was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in HEU than HU infants at 3, 6 and 9 months (- 0.19 vs 2.09; - 0.81 vs 0.28; 0.05 vs 0.97 respectively). The median LAZ score was significantly lower among HU infants at 3 and 6 months (- 1.63 vs 0.91, p < 0.001; - 0.37 vs 0.51, p < 0.01) and a significantly higher proportion of HU was classified as stunted (LAZ < -2SD) at 3 and 6 months (3.9% vs 44.9%, p < 0.001; 4.8% vs 20.9%, p < 0.001 respectively) independent of breastfeeding duration. A higher proportion of HEU infants experienced one or more episodes of skin rash (44.5% vs 12.8%) and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (30.1% vs 10.9%) (p < 0.0001). In a multivariable analysis, the odds of occurrence of wasting, skin rash, URTI or any clinical adverse event in HEU infants were 2.86, 7.06, 3.01 and 8.89 times higher than HU infants after adjusting for breastfeeding duration. CONCLUSION: Our study has generated additional evidence that HEU infants are at substantial risk of infectious morbidity and decreased growth trajectories however we have further demonstrated that these adverse outcomes were independent of breastfeeding duration.","2021-04","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","183","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Conducted at <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Umlazi, a peri-urban low-socioeconomic township in South Africa</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p>1000</p> </div>","","","*HIV; eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Breast Feeding; Infant; South Africa/epidemiology; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; *HIV Infections/epidemiology; *Breastfeeding; *Clinical outcomes; *Growth trajectories; *Infants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed a sustainable and scalable home-based counselling intervention for delivery by community volunteers in rural southern Tanzania to improve newborn care practices and survival. Here we report the effect on newborn care practices one year after full implementation. METHODS: All 132 wards in the 6-district study area were randomised to intervention or comparison groups. Starting in 2010, in intervention areas trained volunteers made home visits during pregnancy and after childbirth to promote recommended newborn care practices including hygiene, breastfeeding and identification and extra care for low birth weight babies. In 2011, in a representative sample of 5,240 households, we asked women who had given birth in the previous year both about counselling visits and their childbirth and newborn care practices. RESULTS: Four of 14 newborn care practices were more commonly reported in intervention than comparison areas: delaying the baby's first bath by at least six hours (81% versus 68%, OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.4)), exclusive breastfeeding in the three days after birth (83% versus 71%, OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.3-2.9)), putting nothing on the cord (87% versus 70%, OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.7-4.6)), and, for home births, tying the cord with a clean thread (69% versus 39%, OR 3.4 (95% CI 1.5-7.5)). For other behaviours there was little evidence of differences in reported practices between intervention and comparison areas including childbirth in a health facility or with a skilled attendant, thermal care practices, breastfeeding within an hour of birth and, for home births, the birth attendant having clean hands, cutting the cord with a clean blade and birth preparedness activities. CONCLUSIONS: A home-based counselling strategy using volunteers and designed for scale-up can improve newborn care behaviours in rural communities of southern Tanzania. Further research is needed to evaluate if, and at what cost, these gains will lead to improved newborn survival.

There is a pressing need to obtain more data on GDM in low- and middle-income countries, especially amongst high-risk populations, as most of the data on GDM comes from high-income countries. With the growing awareness of the role HIV plays in the progression of noncommunicable diseases and the disproportionate HIV burden African countries like Kenya face, investigating the potential role HIV plays in increasing dysglycemia amongst pregnant women with HIV is an important area of study. METHODS: The STRiDE study is one of the largest ever conducted studies of GDM in Kenya. This study enrolled pregnant women aged between 16 and 50 who were receiving care from public and private sector facilities in Eldoret, Kenya. Within this study, women received venous testing for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose between 8- and 20-week gestational age. At their 24-32-week visit, they received a venous 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Because of the pressing need to assess the burden of GDM within the population of pregnant women with HIV, a nested case-control study design was used. Pregnant women with HIV within the larger STRiDE cohort were matched to non-HIV-infected women within the STRiDE cohort at a 1 : 3 ratio based on body mass index, parity, family history of GDM, gestational age, and family history of hypertension. The measurements of glucose from the initial visit (fasting glucose and HbA1c) and follow-up visit (OGTT) were compared between the two groups of HIV+ cases and matched HIV- controls. RESULTS: A total of 83 pregnant women with HIV were well matched to 249 non-HIV-infected women from the STRiDE cohort with marital status being the only characteristic that was statistically significantly different between the two groups. Statistically significant differences were not observed in the proportion of women who developed GDM, the fasting glucose values, the HbA1c, or OGTT measurements between the two groups. Discussion. Significant associations were not seen between the different measures of glycemic status between pregnant women with and without HIV. While significant differences were not seen in this cohort, additional investigation is needed to better describe the association of dysglycemia with HIV, especially in Kenyan populations with a higher prevalence of GDM.","2021","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","8830048","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), Uasin Gishu District Hospital, Langas.

DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal observational study. SETTING: Eight geographically diverse urban regions in Brazil, China, India, Italy, Kenya, Oman, United Kingdom, and United States. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy, well nourished pregnant women enrolled into the Fetal Growth Longitudinal Study component of the INTERGROWTH-21(st) Project at 9-14 weeks' gestation, and followed up until birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symphysis-fundal height was measured every five weeks from 14 weeks' gestation until birth using standardised methods and dedicated research staff who were blinded to the symphysis-fundal height measurements by turning the tape measure so that numbers were not visible during examination. The best fitting curve was selected using second degree fractional polynomials and further modelled in a multilevel framework to account for the longitudinal design of the study. RESULTS: Of 13 108 women screened in the first trimester, 4607 (35.1%) met the study entry criteria. Of the eligible women, 4321 (93.8%) had pregnancies without major complications and delivered live singletons without congenital malformations. The median number of symphysis-fundal height measurements was 5.0 (range 1-7); 3976 (92.0%) women had four or more measurements. Symphysis-fundal height measurements increased almost linearly with gestational age; data were used to determine fitted 3rd, 50th, and 97th centile curves, which showed excellent agreement with observed values. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents international standards to measure symphysis-fundal height as a first level screening tool for fetal growth disturbances.","2016-11","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","i5662","","","355","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Aga Khan University Hospital, MP Shah Hospital, Avenue Hospital ,<span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Aga Khan University Hospital, MP Shah Hospital, Avenue Hospital.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted between 2009 and 2014 in eight countries, including Brazil, China, India, Italy, Kenya, Oman, the UK, and the USA</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">4239</span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Gestational Age; *Anthropometry; Abdomen/*anatomy & histology; Fetal Development/*physiology; Fetal Growth Retardation/diagnosis; Pubic Symphysis; Ultrasonography, Prenatal/*standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimated the incidence of influenza among pregnant women and their infants in Siaya County, Kenya. METHODS: We enrolled women at <31 weeks of gestation and conducted weekly follow-up until 6-month postpartum to identify acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). We defined ARI among mothers as reported cough, rhinorrhoea or sore throat and among infants as maternal-reported cough, difficulty breathing, rhinorrhoea or clinician diagnosis of respiratory illness. We collected nasal/nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from mothers/infants with ARI and tested for influenza A and B using molecular assays. We calculated antenatal incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza among mothers and postnatal incidence among mothers and infants. RESULTS: During June 2015 to May 2020, we analysed data from 3,026 pregnant women at a median gestational age of 16 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 13, 18) and followed 2,550 infants. Incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza during pregnancy (10.3 episodes per 1,000 person-months [95% confidence interval {CI} 8.6-11.8]) was twofold higher than in the postpartum period (4.0 [95% CI 2.6-5.5]; p < 0.01). Incidence was significantly higher among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women (15.6 [95% CI 11.0-20.6] vs. 9.1 [95% CI 7.5-10.8]; p < 0.01). Incidence among young infants was 4.4 (95% CI 3.0-5.9) and similar among HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants.

The majority of neonatal deaths in Kenya and Uganda occur during the intrapartum and immediate postnatal period. This paper describes our study protocol for implementing and evaluating a package of facility-based interventions to improve care during this critical window. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a pair-matched, cluster randomized controlled trial across 20 facilities in Eastern Uganda and Western Kenya. The intervention facilities receive four components: (1) strengthening of routine data collection and data use activities; (2) implementation of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist modified for preterm birth; (3) PRONTO simulation training and mentoring to strengthen intrapartum and immediate newborn care; and (4) support of quality improvement teams. The control facilities receive both data strengthening and introduction of the modified checklist. The primary outcome for this study is 28-day mortality rate among preterm infants. The denominator will include all live births and fresh stillbirths weighing greater than 1000 g and less than 2500 g; all live births and fresh stillbirths weighing between 2501 and 3000 g with a documented gestational age less than 37 weeks. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will inform interventions to improve personnel and facility capacity to respond to preterm labor and delivery, as well as care for the preterm infant.

Although attention has been focused on COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, some experts have warned about potentially devastating secondary health effects. These effects may be most severe in low- and middle-income countries with already weak health care systems. This study examines the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on early infant deaths, a question that is currently unsettled. We present new evidence from Nigeria showing that early infant deaths have significantly increased during the pandemic. Using data on the birth outcomes of a large and diverse cohort of pregnant women enrolled in a prospective study and a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design, we found a 1.1-percentage-point (22 percent) increase and a 0.72-percentage-point (23 percent) increase, respectively, in stillbirths and newborn deaths. Our findings show that the health effects of the pandemic extend beyond counted COVID-19 deaths. If these findings generalize to other low- and middle-income countries, they may indicate that the hard-won gains in child survival made during the past two decades are at risk of being reversed amid the ongoing pandemic. Policies addressing disruptions to health services delivery and providing support to vulnerable groups-specifically to households with pregnant women-will be critical as the pandemic continues.","2021-11","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","1797-1805","","11","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Conducted at 288 primary health facility service areas drawn from four states Kano, Jigawa, Gombe and Akwa Ibom regions of Nigeria</p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>36607</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Nigeria/epidemiology; Infant; Child; *COVID-19; Stillbirth/epidemiology; *Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pregnant women with gestational age 17-34 weeks in Nepal, >/=28 weeks in Mali and 20-36 weeks in South Africa were enrolled. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) was compared with either saline placebo (Nepal and South Africa) or quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Mali). In South Africa, cases were hospitalized and were therefore considered to have severe pneumonia. In Nepal and Mali, severe infant pneumonia diagnosis was based on the WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness definition. RESULTS: A total of 10,002 mothers and 9801 live-born eligible infants were included in the present analysis. There was a 31% lower incidence rate of severe pneumonia in the IIV group compared with the control group in Nepal [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50-0.94; ]. In South Africa, there was a 43% lower incidence rate of severe pneumonia in the IIV group versus the control group (IRR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.33-1.0). There was no difference in incidence rates between the IIV group and the control group in Mali. Overall, incidence rate of severe pneumonia was 20% lower in the IIV group compared with the control group (IRR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.66-0.99; P = 0.04). Protection was highest in the high influenza circulation period (IRR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.23-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal influenza immunization may reduce severe pneumonia episodes among infants-particularly those too young to be completely vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza.","2018-05","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","436-440","","5","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted in three countries, with multiple sites within each country, </span></span><span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Nepal, Mali, South Africa</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(80, 80, 80)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">4193</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Mothers; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant; South Africa/epidemiology; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Mali/epidemiology; Influenza Vaccines/*therapeutic use; Influenza, Human/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Nepal/epidemiology; Data Analysis; Meningococcal Vaccines/*therapeutic use; Pneumonia, Bacterial/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/prevention & control/virology; Vaccination; Vaccines, Conjugate/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is a dearth of literature on the effects of maternal exposure to oil pollution on maternal outcomes in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. This study was therefore designed to determine the effect of maternal exposure to oil pollution on maternal outcomes in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. METHODS: Prospective cohort study design involving 1720 pregnant women followed from pregnancy to delivery was conducted. The participants were 18-45 years old at a gestational age of less than 17 weeks, who attended randomly selected health facilities in the areas with high exposure and low exposure to oil pollution in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and review of medical records from April 2018 to April 2019. Multivariate log-binomial model was used to examine the effect of maternal exposure to oil pollution on the risk of adverse maternal outcomes adjusting for sociodemographic, maternal and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 1418 women completed the follow-up and were included in the analysis. Women in high exposure areas had a higher incidence of premature rupture of membrane (PROM), caesarean section (CS) and postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) compared to women in areas with low exposure to oil pollution. After adjusting for cofounders, women in high exposure areas also had a higher risk of PROM (ARR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.24-3.10) and PPH (ARR = 2.12; 95% CI: 1.28-3.36) in Model I-III when compared to women in areas with low exposure to oil pollution. However, pregnancy-induced hypertension and CS had no association with maternal exposure area status to oil pollution. CONCLUSION: Women in high exposure areas are at a higher risk of PROM and PPH. This calls for policies and intervention toward reducing maternal exposure to oil pollution in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.","2022","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e0263495","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Location Information</span></span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Conducted at health facilities &nbsp;within <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Niger Delta region of Nigeria</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>1720</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; *Petroleum Pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a randomized controlled trial, we found the Texting Improves Testing (TextIT) intervention (a theory-based text messaging system) to be efficacious for improving infant HIV testing rates and maternal retention in prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs. Using an implementation science approach, we aimed to evaluate real-world effectiveness of the intervention. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial with 2 time periods of observation, we randomly allocated 10 clinics to begin implementing the intervention immediately and 10 clinics to begin implementing 6 months later. To approximate real-world conditions, inclusion criteria were broad. Women at clinics implementing the intervention received up to 14 text messages during pregnancy and after delivery and had the option to respond to text messages, call, or send inquiry text messages to a designated clinic phone. The primary outcomes were infant HIV testing and maternal retention in care during the first 8 weeks after delivery. We used modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimation to estimate the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Generalized estimating equations were applied on individual-level data to account for clustering by site. Between February 2015 and December 2016, 4,681 women were assessed for study participation, and 2,515 were included. Participant characteristics at enrollment did not differ by study arm. Overall median age was 27 years (interquartile range [IQR] 23-30), median gestational age was 30 weeks (IQR 28-34), 99% were receiving ART, and 87% who enrolled during intervention phases owned a phone. Of 2,326 infants analyzed, 1,466 of 1,613 (90.9%) in the intervention group and 609 of 713 (85.4%) in the control group met the primary outcome of HIV virologic testing performed before 8 weeks after birth (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.03; 95% CI 0.97-1.10; P = 0.3). Of 2,472 women analyzed, 1,548 of 1,725 (90%) in the intervention group and 571 of 747 (76%) in the control group met the primary outcome of retention in care during the first 8 weeks after delivery (aRR 1.12; 95% CI 0.97-1.30; P = 0.1). This study had two main limitations. Staff at all facilities were aware of ongoing observation, which may have contributed to increased rates of infant HIV testing and maternal retention in care at both intervention and control facilities, and programmatic initiatives to improve maternal and infant retention in care were ongoing at all facilities at the time of this study, which likely limited the ability to demonstrate effectiveness of the trial intervention. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a larger proportion of infants in the intervention group received HIV testing compared with the control group, but the difference was small and not statistically significant. There was also a nonsignificant increase in maternal postpartum retention in the intervention periods. Despite the lack of a significant effect of the intervention, key lessons emerged, both for strengthening PMTCT and for implementation research in general. Perhaps most important, improving the implementation of usual care may have been sufficient to substantially improve infant HIV testing rates.

Large epidemiology studies in these communities are rare, and the impact of such exposures on reproductive outcomes are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between prenatal maternal arsenic and mercury exposure and birth outcomes in both ASGM and non-ASGM communities in Northern Tanzania. METHODS: This longitudinal prospective study included 961 women (ASGM = 788, non-ASGM = 173) of the original cohort of 1056 who were followed until a pregnancy outcome was registered. Maternal spot urine samples and dried blood spots were used to measure total arsenic (T-As) and total mercury (T-Hg) in the second trimester of pregnancy. Data on adverse birth outcomes were collected in 5 categories: spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, and visible congenital anomalies. Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to test for differences between median T-As and T-Hg by area of residence. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of stillbirth and visible congenital anomalies given maternal T-As and T-Hg levels. Modified Poisson regressions were used to estimate relative risk ratios between maternal T-As and T-Hg levels and composite adverse birth outcome, spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, and preterm birth. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in median T-As (9.6 vs. 6.3 microg/L, Mann-Whitney U-tests, Z = -3.50, p < 0.001) and median T-Hg blood concentrations (1.2 vs. 0.70 microg/L, Z = -9.88, p-value < 0.001) between women living in ASGM and non-ASGM areas respectively. In ASGM areas, the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of a composite adverse birth outcome increased with increasing T-As (aRR 1.23, 95%CI: 1.14-1.33, p < 0.0001) and T-Hg (aRR 1.17, 95%CI: 1.1-1.25, p < 0.0001) exposure. Spontaneous abortion (aRR 1.53, 95%CI: 1.28-1.83), stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.97, 95%CI: 1.45-2.66) and preterm birth (1.17, 95%CI: 1.01-1.36) were significantly associated with elevated T-As, whereas elevated T-Hg was significantly associated with stillbirth (aOR 2.49, 95%CI: 1.88-3.29) and visible congenital anomalies (aOR 2.24, 95%CI: 1.3-3.87). CONCLUSION: Over half (54.7%) of women in ASGM areas of Northern Tanzania had adverse birth outcomes and the risk of adverse birth outcomes was significantly associated with increased prenatal exposure to arsenic and mercury.","2020-04","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","105450","","","137","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in two districts in Tanzania: Geita District and Magu District.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)"">1078</span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; *Pregnancy Outcome; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Stillbirth; Tanzania; *Arsenic; *Arsenic/toxicity; *Birth outcome; *Maternal Exposure; *Mercury; *Mercury/toxicity; *Mining; *Prenatal exposure; *Preterm birth; *Spontaneous abortion; Abortion, Spontaneous; Congenital Abnormalities; Environmental Exposure; Gold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed to evaluate the extent of adherence and its determinants in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of Fe prophylaxis during pregnancy in Maputo, Mozambique. DESIGN: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Two health centres (1 degrees de Maio and Machava) in Maputo, Mozambique. SUBJECTS: Pregnant women (>/=12 weeks' gestation, >/=18 years old, non-high-risk pregnancy; n 4326) attending prenatal care consultations at two health centres were randomized to receive routine Fe (n 2184; 60 mg ferrous sulfate plus 400 mug folic acid daily throughout pregnancy) or selective Fe (n 2142; screening and treatment for anaemia and daily intake of 1 mg folic acid). RESULTS: The level of adherence was 79% for having two or more visits, 53% for adequate prenatal care and 67% for complete intake of Fe/folic acid tablets during the trial. The correlation between the adherence measures ranged between 0.151 and 0.739. Adherence did not differ by trial arm, but there were centre differences in adequate prenatal visits and intake of tablets. Older women (>20 years) and those with a history of abortion were more likely to achieve greater adherence, whereas an increased number of previous births decreased the likelihood of adherence. HIV positivity decreased the likelihood of adherence in one trial centre and increased it in the other. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in adherence by trial centre, women's characteristics and outcome measures suggests that adherence in trials fully depends on participants' behaviour and can be increased by paying attention to contextual factors.","2015-04","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","1127-34","","6","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1o&nbsp;de Maio ,Machava</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Two health centres (1o&nbsp;de Maio and Machava) in Maputo, Mozambique.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>4326</p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Dietary Supplements; Young Adult; Adolescent; Developing Countries; Mozambique; *Patient Compliance; *Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/blood/complications/*prevention & control/virology; Community Health Centers; Ferrous Compounds/administration & dosage; Folic Acid/therapeutic use; Hematinics/*therapeutic use; HIV Seropositivity/complications/virology; Iron, Dietary/*therapeutic use; Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/blood/*prevention & control/virology; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/blood/virology; Reproductive History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the impact of maternal HIV infection on the burden of RSV among mothers and their infants in western Kenya. METHODS: We enrolled pregnant women (</=20 weeks gestation) and followed them and their newborns weekly for up to 3-6 months post-partum, to document cases of acute respiratory illness (ARI). Nasal/ oropharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for RSV using polymerase chain reaction. Analyses were stratified by maternal HIV-status, and incidence computed per 1,000 person-months. RESULTS: Compared to RSV-negative ARI cases, RSV-positive cases were associated with cough, apnoea and hospitalization among infants. RSV incidence per 1,000 person-months among mothers was 4.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.2-4.4), and was twice that among the HIV-infected (8.4; 95% CI, 5.7-12.0) compared to the HIV-uninfected mothers (3.1; 95% CI 2.3-4.0). Among infants, incidence per 1,000 person-months was 15.4 (95% CI, 12.5-18.8); incidence did not differ by HIV exposure or prematurity. CONCLUSION: HIV-infection may increase the risk of RSV illness among pregnant women.

However, little evidence is available on whether maternal nutrition counselling alone can influence birth weight among women from low socioeconomic households. This study assessed the effect of prenatal maternal nutritional counselling on birth weight and examined the related risk factors. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness of home-based maternal nutritional counselling on nutritional outcomes, morbidity, breastfeeding, and infant feeding practices by the African Population and Health Research Center in two urban informal settlements of Nairobi. The intervention group received monthly antenatal and nutritional counselling from trained community health volunteers; meanwhile, the control group received routine antenatal care. A total of 1001 participants were included for analysis. Logistic regression was applied to determine associations between low birth weight and maternal characteristics. A higher prevalence of low birth weight was observed in the control group (6.7%) than in the intervention group (2.5%; P&lt;0.001). Logistic regression identified significant associations between birth weight and intervention group (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.10-0.64); maternal height &lt;154.5 cm (AOR=3.33; 95% CI, 1.01-10.96); last antenatal care visits at 1st or 2nd trimesters (AOR=9.48; 95% CI, 3.72-24.15); pre-term delivery (AOR=3.93; 95% CI, 1.93-7.98); maternal mid-upper arm circumference &lt;23 cm (AOR=2.57; 95% CI, 1.15-5.78); and cesarean delivery (AOR=2.27; 95% CI, 1.04-4.94).

Placental malaria is more common in primigravidae than multigravidae, but the relationship between HIV and malaria across gravidities is not well characterized. We recruited pregnant Malawian women during the second trimester and followed them until delivery. Parasitemia was assessed at enrollment, follow-up visits, and delivery, when placental blood was sampled. There was no difference in risk of parasitemia between HIV-positive and HIV-negative primigravidae. Among multigravidae, HIV-infected women had greater than twice the risk of parasitemia as HIV-uninfected women throughout follow-up. Human immunodeficiency virus was also associated with more frequent peripheral parasitemia in multigravidae but not primigravidae. Both HIV and primigravid status were independently associated with higher peripheral and placental parasite densities. Although risk of parasitemia is lower in multigravidae than primigravidae, the HIV effect on risk of malaria is more pronounced in multigravidae.","2012-12","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","1022-7","","6","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Mpemba Health Center , Madziabango Health Center </span></span><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted at the Mpemba and Madziabango Health Centers in Blantyre District, located in southern Malawi</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>1366</p> </div>","C:\Users\leon.mbano\Zotero\storage\VS5CS7SQ\Nkhoma ET et al. - 2012 - The effect of HIV infection on the risk, frequency.pdf","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Malawi/epidemiology; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Risk Factors; Multivariate Analysis; Plasmodium falciparum; *Parity; HIV Infections/*complications/epidemiology; Malaria, Falciparum/*complications/epidemiology/parasitology; Parasitemia; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*parasitology/*virology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Cross-sectional data of mother-newborn pairs collected in 2017 in the DRC were compared with mother-newborn pairs data from the SA Soweto first 1000-days pregnancy cohort study (2013-2016). Country-specific and pooled multivariable logistic regressions analyses assessed the associations between maternal education, marital status, and housing with LBW, SGA, and PTB adjusted for maternal anthropometry and obstetric factors. RESULTS: 1084 mother-newborn pairs were recruited (DRC: 256; SA: 828). The rates of LBW, PTB and SGA were, 11.5%, 17.1% and 32.8% in the DRC and 15.9%, 10.5% and 20.1% in SA. SES factors differed between countries and sex. In the DRC, being married decreased the odds of having LBW and PTB children by 86% and 80%, respectively. In SA, being a mother with secondary level of education and above was associated with 86% reduced odds of SGA. In the pooled analyses, women with secondary level of education and above had a 2.2-fold increase in odds of giving birth to a PTB newborn. Country of residence and maternal nutritional status were stronger predictors of birth outcomes than SES factors. CONCLUSION FOR PRACTICE: In sub-Saharan Africa, policies aiming to alleviate women's education combined with improved social support and household SES prior to and during pregnancy are critical to optimal neonatal outcomes and strategic to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.","2021-08","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","1296-1304","","8","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Conducted inSouth Africa , Soweto &amp; <span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size : </strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>4000</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Risk Factors; Birth outcomes; South Africa; Socioeconomic Factors; Child; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; *Premature Birth/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Democratic Republic of the Congo/epidemiology; Democratic Republic of Congo; Socioeconomic factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, there is insufficient information on the safety and efficacy of most antimalarials in pregnancy. Indeed, clinical trials assessing antimalarial treatments systematically exclude pregnancy for fear of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. The little available information originates from South East Asia while in sub-Saharan Africa such information is still limited and needs to be provided. DESIGN: A Phase 3, non-inferiority, multicentre, randomized, open-label clinical trial on safety and efficacy of 4 ACT when administered during pregnancy was carried out in 4 African countries: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi and Zambia. This is a four arm trial using a balanced incomplete block design. Pregnant women diagnosed with malaria are randomised to receive either amodiaquine-artesunate (AQ-AS), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), or mefloquine-artesunate (MQAS). They are actively followed up until day 63 post-treatment and then monthly until 4-6 weeks post-delivery. The offspring is visited at the time of the first birthday. The primary endpoint is treatment failure (PCR adjusted) at day 63 and safety profiles. Secondary endpoints included PCR unadjusted treatment failure up to day 63, gametocyte carriage, Hb changes, placenta malaria, mean birth weight and low birth weight. The primary statistical analysis will use the combined data from all 4 centres, with adjustment for any centre effects, using an additive model for the response rates. This will allow the assessment of all 6 possible pair-wise treatment comparisons using all available data. DISCUSSION: The strength of this trial is the involvement of several African countries, increasing the generalisability of the results. In addition, it assesses most ACTs currently available, determining their relative '-value-' compared to others. The balanced incomplete block design was chosen because using all 4-arms in each site would have increased complexity in terms of implementation. Excluding HIV-positive pregnant women on antiretroviral drugs may be seen as a limitation because of the possible interactions between antiretroviral and antimalarial treatments. Nevertheless, the results of this trial will provide the evidence base for the formulation of malaria treatment policy for pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa.","2015-01","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","5","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Nanoro , Nazoanga, Effiduase, Ejisu, Juaben , &nbsp;Chikwawa , &nbsp;Nchelenge</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facility</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>Conducted in 7 sites</p> <ol> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Burkina Faso: Nanoro and Nazoanga</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Ghana: Effiduase, Ejisu, and Juaben</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Malawi: Chikwawa</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Zambia: Nchelenge</span></span> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>3428</p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Ghana; Infant, Newborn; Drug Combinations; Malawi; Follow-Up Studies; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Malaria/*drug therapy; Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic/*drug therapy; Zambia; Burkina Faso; Antimalarials/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Artemether, Lumefantrine Drug Combination; Artemisinins/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Fetal Development/drug effects; Amodiaquine/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Artesunate; Birth Weight/drug effects; Ethanolamines/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Fluorenes/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Mefloquine/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Placentation/drug effects; Quinolines/adverse effects/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Novel strategies are required to address this challenge. We compared 12-month maternal and HEI postpartum retention in health facilities implementing the following HIV care delivery models: integrated HIV and maternal, neonatal, and child health services [mother-infant pair (MIP) clinics], MIP clinics plus short-text messaging service (SMS) reminders to prevent default (MIP + SMS), and standard of care (SOC). METHODS: From May 2013 to August 2016, a cluster randomized trial was conducted in rural Malawi, which randomized 30 health facilities to the 3 service delivery models. HIV+ pregnant women and HEIs were enrolled and followed up to monitor compliance with prescheduled visits and retention. Log binomial regression, using generalized estimated equation, was used to assess the impact of the models on retention. RESULTS: The trial enrolled 461, 493, and 396 HIV+ pregnant women and 386, 399, and 300 HEIs into the MIP, MIP + SMS, and SOC arms, respectively. Compared with the 12-month maternal retention rate in the SOC arm (22.2%), the rates were similar in the MIP arm [19.3%, risk ratio (RR): 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56 to 1.30] and in the MIP + SMS arm (24.9%, RR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.35). Compared with the 12-month infant retention rate in the SOC arm (9.8%), the rates were similar in the MIP arm (8.0%, RR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.31 to 2.58) and in the MIP + SMS arm (19.5%, RR: 1.40, 95% CI: 0.85 to 2.31).

Central to elimination of MTCT is effective Provider Initiated HIV Counseling and Testing (PICT). Research has shown that conducting PICT only at the initial antenatal care (ANC) visit fails to benefit pregnant women who seroconvert later in their pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the most cost effective time to perform repeat HIV testing during ANC and perinatal care (PNC). METHODS: We studied the repeat HIV testing results of pregnant women >/= 18 and adolescent girls aged 15-17 in the Sauri, Kenya Millennium Villages Project (MVP) site. Nurses provided HIV screening to 1,403 expectant women and 256 adolescent girls following the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th ANC visits, at birth and 6 and 14 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Five women seroconverted during the study period (incidence proportion 0.41%). One woman seroconverted at the 2nd ANC visit, another one at the 3rd, two at the 4th and one at 6 weeks post-partum. Of all the women who seroconverted, four reported an HIV negative primary partner, while one reported an unknown partner status. None of the participants reported condom use during pregnancy. Two of the seroconverters vertically transmitted HIV to their babies. The results did not suggest a clear pattern of seroconversion during ANC and PNC. CONCLUSIONS: The low rates of seroconversion suggest that testing pregnant women multiple times during ANC and PNC may not be cost effective, but a follow-up test during birth may be protective of the newborn.","2020","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e0233396","","5","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Sauri cluster</p> <p><strong>Location type :</strong></p> <p>Communities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black"">Conducted in Sauri cluster, located in Siaya County, Western Kenya</span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong> <span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">2,100</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; Adolescent; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Health Resources; Kenya; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*diagnosis; AIDS Serodiagnosis/economics/methods; HIV Infections/*complications/*prevention & control/transmission; HIV Seropositivity/*complications/*diagnosis; Perinatal Care/economics/methods; Prenatal Care/economics/methods; Proof of Concept Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We describe the rationale and methods of the Maternal and Child Health-Antiretroviral Therapy (MCH-ART) study, an implementation science project examining strategies for providing HIV care and treatment to HIV-infected women who initiate ART during pregnancy and their HIV-exposed infants. RESULTS: MCH-ART is composed of 3 interrelated study designs across the antenatal and postnatal periods. Phase 1 is a cross-sectional evaluation of consecutive HIV-infected pregnant women seeking antenatal care; phase 2 is an observational cohort of all women from phase 1 who are eligible for initiation of ART following local guidelines; and phase 3 is a randomized trial of strategies for delivering ART to breastfeeding women from phase 2 during the postpartum period. During each phase, a set of study measurement visits is carried out separately from antenatal care and ART services; a maximum of 9 visits takes place from the beginning of antenatal care through 12 months postpartum. In parallel, in-depth interviews are used to examine issues of ART adherence and retention qualitatively, and costs and cost-effectiveness of models of care are examined. Separate substudies examine health outcomes in HIV-uninfected women and their HIV-unexposed infants, and the role of the adherence club model for long-term adherence and retention.

However, there are limited data on maternal virological responses during pregnancy and the postpartum period in South Africa (SA). OBJECTIVES: To review compliance of viral load (VL) testing with national guidelines and suppression rates during pregnancy and up to 9 months postpartum among WLHIV delivering in four tertiary hospitals in Gauteng Province, SA. METHODS: All women who had a point-of-care HIV VL test using Xpert HIV-1 VL (Cepheid, USA) at delivery in four tertiary obstetric units in Gauteng between June 2018 and February 2020 were included. HIV VL tests of eligible women performed up to 9 months before and after delivery were extracted from the National Health Laboratory Service's Corporate Data Warehouse. Proportions of women delivering who had antenatal and postpartum VL tests performed and their suppression rates were determined and expressed as percentages. RESULTS: Of 4 989 eligible WLHIV (median age 31.1 years), 917 (18.4%) had a VL performed during the antenatal period; of these, 335 (36.5%) had a VL >/=50 copies/mL and 165 (18.0%) a VL >/=1 000 copies/mL. At delivery, 1 911 women (38.3%) had a VL >/=50 copies/mL and 1 028 (20.6%) a VL >/=1 000 copies/mL. Among 627 women (12.6%) with a VL test postpartum, 234 (37.3%) had a VL >/=50 copies/mL and 93 (14.8%) a VL >/=1 000 copies/mL. Overall, having a VL test performed during the antenatal period was associated with viral suppression at delivery and receiving a VL test postpartum (p&lt;0.001). Women with a VL >/=50 copies/mL at delivery were more likely to be younger and to remain virally unsuppressed postpartum (p&lt;0.001) compared with women with a VL &lt;50 copies/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer than 5% of WLHIV with a VL at the time of delivery received VL monitoring during the antenatal and postpartum periods in accordance with national guidelines. More than 80% of WLHIV delivering had no evidence of VL monitoring during the antenatal period, and they were more likely than women who received monitoring during the antenatal period to be virally unsuppressed at delivery and to receive no VL monitoring postpartum. Women with a high VL at delivery were likely to remain virally unsuppressed postpartum. These results emphasise the need for closer monitoring of and rapid reaction to high maternal VLs during pregnancy, at delivery and postpartum for attainment of eMTCT.","2021-04","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","469-473","","5","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: South Africa","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in four tertiary obstetric units in Gauteng, South Africa</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">4 989</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Breast Feeding; Middle Aged; South Africa; Prenatal Care; *Postnatal Care; Age Factors; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/prevention & control; Tertiary Care Centers; HIV Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology/virology; *Viral Load; Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage; Point-of-Care Testing; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/drug therapy/*virology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is especially true for medication against tropical diseases because pharmacovigilance systems are not much developed in these settings. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate feasibility of using Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) as a platform to monitor drug safety in pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women with gestational age below 20 weeks were recruited from Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) clinics or from monthly house visits carried out for the HDSS. A structured questionnaire was used to interview pregnant women. Participants were followed on monthly basis to record any new drug used as well as pregnancy outcome. RESULTS: 1089 pregnant women were recruited; 994 (91.3%) completed the follow-up until delivery. 98% women reported to have taken at least one medication during pregnancy, mainly those used in antenatal programmes. Other most reported drugs were analgesics (24%), antibiotics (17%), and antimalarial (15%), excluding IPTp. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was the most used antimalarial for treating illness by nearly 3/4 compared to other groups of malaria drugs. Overall, antimalarial and antibiotic exposures in pregnancy were not significantly associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Iron and folic acid supplementation were associated with decreased risk of miscarriage/stillbirth (OR 0.1; 0.08-0.3). CONCLUSION: Almost all women were exposed to medication during pregnancy. Exposure to iron and folic acid had a beneficial effect on pregnancy outcome. HDSS proved to be a useful platform to establish a reliable pharmacovigilance system in resource-limited countries. Widening drug safety information is essential to facilitate evidence based risk-benefit decision for treatment during pregnancy, a major challenge with newly marketed medicines.","2014-09","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","322","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Name not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities and community</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in the Rufiji Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) located in the Coastal region of Eastern Tanzania.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1089&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Gestational Age; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Stillbirth/*epidemiology; Feasibility Studies; Tanzania/epidemiology; Dietary Supplements; Folic Acid/therapeutic use; Abortion, Spontaneous/*epidemiology; Vitamins/therapeutic use; *Pharmacovigilance; Anti-Infective Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Antitussive Agents/therapeutic use; Congenital Abnormalities/epidemiology; Ferrous Compounds/therapeutic use; Live Birth; Minerals/therapeutic use; Population Surveillance/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: All primigravidae who booked for antenatal care were followed up until hospital discharge. Relevant clinical and demographic data were collected in structured data forms. RESULTS: A total of 5860 primigravidae delivered during the study period. Of these, 731 had an HDP, giving an incidence of 12.5%. The diagnosis of gestational hypertension was made in 6.7% of all primigravidae but was the commonest HDP subcategory (n = 394/731; 53.9%). On the other hand, mild to moderate preeclampsia or non-severe preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and eclampsia occurred in 222, 84, and 31 of the 5860 primigravidae, respectively. Therefore, preeclampsia-eclampsia syndrome occurred in 337/5860 or 5.75% of the study population. Severe preeclampsia occurred in 1.43% (84/5860) of the primigravidae. The rates of caesarean deliveries in women with preeclampsia were approximately 50%. There were no perinatal deaths in the gestational hypertension group, but the overall perinatal mortality rate in all preeclamptics was 5.9%, in comparison to 2.2% in all primigravidae. CONCLUSION: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy developed in 12.5% (n = 731/5860) of primigravidae seen over a one-year period. Gestational hypertension comprised the commonest subcategory of the HDP and there were no perinatal deaths in this group.","2016-11","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","529-535","","4","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Name not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in South Africa, specifically among primigravid Black South Africans.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>731</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Prevalence; Pregnancy Outcome; South Africa/epidemiology; *Parity; Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; *African Continental Ancestry Group; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced/epidemiology/*ethnology; obstetric outcomes; primigravidae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several prenatal exposure factors influence the fetal environment. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of prenatal exposure factors, including socio-demographic, behavioural, dietary, physical activity, clinical and environmental on birth outcomes through the mediation of Favourable Fetal Growth Conditions (FFGC). METHODS: Data was obtained from six hundred and fifty-six Mother and Child in the Environment birth cohort study in Durban, South Africa from 2013 to 2017. We adopted structural equation models which evaluate the direct and indirect effects by allowing multiple simultaneous equations to incorporate confounding and mediation. RESULTS: A significant direct and indirect effect of FFGC on newborn weight, length, and gestational age was seen. Gestational weight gain and maternal body mass index in the first trimester exerted a mediation effect between maternal behavioural risk factors and FFGC. Similarly, the level of physical activity during pregnancy was associated with decreased gestational weight gain. The effects of maternal characteristics on newborn weight, length, and gestational age were largely indirect, operating through FFGC as a latent variable. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational weight gain and maternal pre-gestational BMI were observed to mediate the association between prenatal behavioural risk factors and favourable fetal growth conditions.

The prevalence of the condition is likely to increase across Africa as the continent undergoes a rapid demographic transition. However, little is known about the management and pregnancy outcomes associated with HIP in the region, particularly less severe forms of hyperglycaemia. It is therefore important to generate local data so that resources may be distributed effectively. The aim of this study was to describe the antenatal management and maternal/fetal outcomes associated with HIP in Ugandan women. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 2917 pregnant women in five major hospitals in urban/semi-urban central Uganda. Women were screened with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Cases of gestational diabetes (GDM) and diabetes in pregnancy (DIP) were identified (WHO 2013 diagnostic criteria) and received standard care. Data was collected on maternal demographics, anthropometrics, antenatal management, umbilical cord c-peptide levels, and pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-six women were diagnosed with HIP (237 classified as GDM and 39 DIP). Women had between one and four fasting capillary blood glucose checks during third trimester. All received lifestyle advice, one quarter (69/276) received metformin therapy, and one woman received insulin. HIP was associated with large birthweight (unadjusted relative risk 1.30, 95% CI 1.00-1.68), Caesarean delivery (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.57) and neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.36-14.1), but not perinatal mortality or preterm birth. Pregnancy outcomes were generally worse for women with DIP compared with GDM. CONCLUSION: HIP is associated with significant adverse pregnancy outcomes in this population, particularly overt diabetes in pregnancy. However pregnancy outcomes in women with milder forms of hyperglycaemia are similar to those with normoglycaemic pregnancies. Intervention strategies are required to improve current monitoring and management practice, and more research needed to understand if this is a cost-effective way of preventing poor perinatal outcomes.","2021-05","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","386","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in five major hospitals in urban and peri-urban areas of central Uganda</span></span></p> <ul> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Three public facilities managed by the Uganda Ministry of Health</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Two private-not-for-profit hospitals managed by the Uganda Catholic Medical Services Bureau</span></span> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>3852</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Uganda/epidemiology; Young Adult; Male; Pregnancy Outcome/*epidemiology; Diabetes; Diabetes, Gestational/blood/*epidemiology; Gestational; Hospitals; Hyperglycemia/blood/*epidemiology; Macrosomia; Sub Saharan-Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alcohol use was measured using a modified version of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). HIV sexual risk was measured through a composite variable of four risk factors: diagnosis with a STI, self-report of > 1 recent sex partners, partner HIV serostatus (unknown or HIV+) and condomless sex at last sex. Any past year alcohol use prior to pregnancy was reported by half of participants (50%); 6.0% reported alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol use prior to pregnancy was associated with increased odds of being at high risk of HIV (aOR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.68, for 2 risks and aOR = 1.47, 95% CI 0.95-2.27 for 3 risks). In addition to reducing alcohol use, several other strategies to address HIV sexual risk were identified. Evidence-based interventions to address alcohol use and other HIV sexual risk behaviors during pregnancy in South Africa are desperately needed. Qualitative work exploring individual and community level drivers of alcohol use among pregnant and breastfeeding women in this setting could support development of a culturally tailored intervention to address these issues in this population.","2022-06","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Name not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: #0D0D0D""><span style=""background-color: white"">Conducted at one public health clinic in Gugulethu,Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;1201</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Pregnancy; South Africa; HIV; Sub-Saharan Africa; Alcohol use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prevalence of STIs among pregnant women in South Africa remains high, with most women being asymptomatic for their infection(s). Unfortunately, most STIs remain undetected and untreated due to standard practice syndromic management in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Although lab-based and point-of-care molecular tests are available, optimal screening strategies during pregnancy, their health impact, and cost-effectiveness are unknown. METHODS: We will implement a 3-arm (1:1:1) type-1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized-controlled trial (RCT). We will enroll 2500 pregnant women attending their first antenatal care (ANC) visit for their current pregnancy at participating health facilities in Buffalo City Metro District, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Participants allocated to arms 1 and 2 (intervention) will receive GeneXpert(R) point-of-care diagnostic testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, with same-day treatment for detected infection(s). Arm 1 will additionally receive a test-of-cure 3 weeks post-treatment, while Arm 2 will receive a repeat test at 30-34 weeks' gestation. Those allocated to Arm 3 will receive syndromic management (standard-of-care). The RE-AIM framework will be used to guide collection of implementation indicators to inform potential future scale up. Primary outcome measures include (1) frequency of adverse birth outcomes among study arms, defined by a composite measure of low birth weight and pre-term delivery, and (2) change in STI prevalence between baseline and birth outcome among intervention arms and compared to standard-of-care. Estimates and comparative costs of the different screening strategies relative to standard-of-care and the costs of managing adverse birth outcomes will be calculated. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed per STI and disability-adjusted life year averted. DISCUSSION: This trial is the first RCT designed to identify optimal, cost-effective screening strategies that decrease the burden of STIs during pregnancy and reduce adverse birth outcomes. Demonstrating the impact of diagnostic screening and treatment, compared to syndromic management, on birth outcomes will provide critical evidence to inform changes to WHO guidelines for syndromic management of STIs during pregnancy.

Whether or not ultrasound use will improve care and ultimately pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings is unknown. METHODS/DESIGN: This multi-country cluster randomized trial will assess the impact of antenatal ultrasound screening performed by health care staff on a composite outcome consisting of maternal mortality and maternal near-miss, stillbirth and neonatal mortality in low-resource community settings. The trial will utilize an existing research infrastructure, the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research with sites in Pakistan, Kenya, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Guatemala. A maternal and newborn health registry in defined geographic areas which documents all pregnancies and their outcomes to 6 weeks post-delivery will provide population-based rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, stillbirth, neonatal mortality and morbidity, and health care utilization for study clusters. A total of 58 study clusters each with a health center and about 500 births per year will be randomized (29 intervention and 29 control). The intervention includes training of health workers (e.g., nurses, midwives, clinical officers) to perform ultrasound examinations during antenatal care, generally at 18-22 and at 32-36 weeks for each subject. Women who are identified as having a complication of pregnancy will be referred to a hospital for appropriate care. Finally, the intervention includes community sensitization activities to inform women and their families of the availability of ultrasound at the antenatal care clinic and training in emergency obstetric and neonatal care at referral facilities. DISCUSSION: In summary, our trial will evaluate whether introduction of ultrasound during antenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes in rural, low-resource settings. The intervention includes training for ultrasound-naive providers in basic obstetric ultrasonography and then enabling these trainees to use ultrasound to screen for pregnancy complications in primary antenatal care clinics and to refer appropriately.

Intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women (IPTp) for malaria with sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine (SP) has since replaced prophylaxis and legislation has been reinforced in the area of insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs) in Cameroon. Clinical malaria despite all these measures remains a problem. We compared the socio-obstetrical characteristics of women who developed clinical malaria and those who did not though in the same regimen. METHODS: A 5 - year nested cohort study (2007 - 2011 inclusive) at the tertiary level hospitals in Yaounde. Pregnant women who willingly accepted to participate in the study were enrolled at booking and three doses of SP were administered between 18 - 20 weeks of gestation, between 26-28 weeks and between 32 - 34 weeks. Those who developed clinical malaria were considered as cases and were compared for socio - obstetrical characteristics with those who did not. Venous blood was drawn from the women in both arms for parasite density estimation and identification and all the clinical cases were treated conventionally. RESULTS: Each arm had 166 cases and many women who developed clinical malaria were between 15 and 19 years (OR 5.5, 95% CI 3.9 - 5.3, p < 0.001). They were of low gravidity (OR 6.5, 95% CI 3.8 - 11.3, p < 0.001) as well as low parity (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.7 - 7.9, p < 0.001). The cases were single women (OR 4.58, 95% CI 2.54 - 8.26, p < 0.001) and had attained only primary level of education (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.8 - 7.9, p < 0.001). Gestational ages were between 20 to 30 weeks during clinical malaria (OR 6.8, 95% CI 4.1 - 11.7, p < 0.001). The time between the first and second dose of SP was longer than ten weeks in the cases (OR 5.5, 95% CI 3.2 - 9.3, p < 0.001) and parasite density was higher also among the cases (OR 6.9, 95% CI 5.9 - 12.1, p < 0.001).

E4E is a cluster-randomized trial with 2 arms; Standard of care and ""POC Plus"" [in which point-of-care (POC) CD4 devices and related counseling support are provided]; aimed at improving retention-in-care of HIV-infected pregnant women and mothers. In November 2013, Zimbabwe adopted Option B+ for HIV-positive pregnant women under which antiretroviral treatment eligibility is no longer based on CD4 count. However, Ministry of Health and Child Care guidelines still require baseline and 6-monthly CD4 testing for treatment monitoring, until viral load testing becomes widely available. Considering the current limited capacity for viral-load testing, the significant investments in CD4 testing already made and the historical reliance on CD4 by health care workers for determining eligibility for antiretroviral treatment, E4E seeks to compare the impact of the provision of POC CD4 technology and early knowledge of CD4 levels on retention-in-care at 12 months, with the current standard of routine, laboratory-based CD4 testing. The study also compares rates of initiation and time-to-initiation between the 2 arms and according to level of maternal CD4 count, the cost of retaining HIV-positive pregnant women in care and the acceptability and feasibility of POC CD4 in the context of Option B+. Outcome measures are derived from routine health systems data. E4E will provide data on POC CD4 testing and retention-in-care associated with Option B+ and serve as an early learning platform to inform implementation of Option B+ in Zimbabwe.","2014-11","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","S139-44","","","67 Suppl 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">&nbsp;Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted in Zimbabwe, specifically at 16 sites</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>1150</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use; *Patient Compliance; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*drug therapy/prevention & control; HIV Infections/complications/*drug therapy/transmission; *CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Sample Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study measured the effect of home visits combined with mobile phone consultations on maternal and newborn care practices. METHOD: In a community intervention trial design 16 health centres in Masindi and Kiryandongo districts, Uganda were randomly and equally allocated to one of two arms: control and intervention arms. Eight control health centres received the usual maternal and newborn educational messages offered by professional health workers and eight intervention health centres that received an intervention package for maternal care and essential newborn care practices. In the intervention arm VHTs made two prenatal and one postnatal home visit to households. VHTs were provided with mobile phones to enable them make regular telephone consultations with health workers at the health centre serving the catchment area. The primary outcome was health facility delivery. Other outcomes included antenatal attendances, birth preparedness, cord and thermal care and breastfeeding practices. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: A total of 1385 pregnant women were analysed: 758 and 627 in the control and intervention arms respectively. Significant post-intervention differences were: delivery place [adjusted Odds Ratio aOR: 17.94(95%CI: 6.26-51.37); p<0.001], cord care [aOR: 3.05(95%CI: 1.81-5.12); p<0.001] thermal care [aOR: 7.58(95%CI: 2.52-22.82); p<0.001], and timely care-seeking for newborn illness [aOR: 4.93(95%CI: 1.59-15.31); p = 0.006]. CONCLUSION: VHTs can have an effect in promoting proper cord and thermal care for the newborn and improve timely care-seeking for health facility delivery and newborn illness, because they could answer questions and refer patients correctly. However, VHTs should be supported by professional health workers through the use of mobile phones.

This study evaluated factors influencing maternal/infant access to healthcare facilities to identify potential barriers to participation in future clinical trials on maternal vaccination. METHODS: In this prospective, multi-centre, observational study, pregnant women (N = 3243) were enrolled at ten sites across Panama, the Dominican Republic, South Africa, and Mozambique between 2012 and 2014. They completed questionnaires at enrolment, delivery, and infant follow-up (90 days post-partum) visits, including questions on transportation, phone accessibility, alternative childcare, gestational age at enrolment, delivery location, and health status of their infant. Logistic regression was used to identify factors significantly associated with return to study site for delivery or infant follow-up visits. RESULTS: Among 3229 enrolled women with delivery information, 63.6% (range across sites: 25.3-91.5%) returned to study site for delivery. Older women and those at later gestational age at enrolment were more likely to deliver at the study site. While heterogeneities were observed at site level, shorter travel time at delivery and increased transportation costs at enrolment were associated with increased likelihood of women returning to study site for delivery. Among 3145 women with live-born infants, 3077 (95.3%) provided 90-day follow-up information; of these, 68.9% (range across sites: 25.6-98.9%) returned to study site for follow-up visits. Women with other children and with lower transportation costs at delivery were more likely to return to study site for follow-up visits. Among 666 infants reported sick, 94.3% were taken to a healthcare facility, with only 41.9% (range across sites: 4.9-77.3%) to the study site. CONCLUSION: Although high retention was observed from enrolment through 90 days after delivery, post-partum surveillance should be broadened beyond the study sites and additional follow-up visits should be planned within the neonatal period. The factors influencing maternal/infant access to healthcare facilities and the issues identified in this study should be taken into consideration in planning future clinical studies on maternal immunisation in low- and middle-income countries.

METHODS: We conducted two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) in South Africa during 2011 in pregnant women infected with HIV and during 2011 and 2012 in pregnant women who were not infected. The immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of IIV3 in pregnant women and their infants were evaluated until 24 weeks after birth. Immune responses were measured with a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, and influenza was diagnosed by means of reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays of respiratory samples. RESULTS: The study cohorts included 2116 pregnant women who were not infected with HIV and 194 pregnant women who were infected with HIV. At 1 month after vaccination, seroconversion rates and the proportion of participants with HAI titers of 1:40 or more were higher among IIV3 recipients than among placebo recipients in both cohorts. Newborns of IIV3 recipients also had higher HAI titers than newborns of placebo recipients. The attack rate for RT-PCR-confirmed influenza among both HIV-uninfected placebo recipients and their infants was 3.6%. The attack rates among HIV-uninfected IIV3 recipients and their infants were 1.8% and 1.9%, respectively, and the respective vaccine-efficacy rates were 50.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.5 to 71.2) and 48.8% (95% CI, 11.6 to 70.4). Among HIV-infected women, the attack rate for placebo recipients was 17.0% and the rate for IIV3 recipients was 7.0%; the vaccine-efficacy rate for these IIV3 recipients was 57.7% (95% CI, 0.2 to 82.1). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccine was immunogenic in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected pregnant women and provided partial protection against confirmed influenza in both groups of women and in infants who were not exposed to HIV.

WHO recommends intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP). However, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) efficacy is threatened by high-level parasite resistance. We conducted a trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of scheduled intermittent screening with malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and treatment of RDT-positive women with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) as an alternative strategy to IPTp-SP. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was an open-label, two-arm individually randomized superiority trial among HIV-seronegative women at three sites in Malawi with high SP resistance. The intervention consisted of three or four scheduled visits in the second and third trimester, 4 to 6 wk apart. Women in the IPTp-SP arm received SP at each visit. Women in the intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy with DP (ISTp-DP) arm were screened for malaria at every visit and treated with DP if RDT-positive. The primary outcomes were adverse live birth outcome (composite of small for gestational age, low birthweight [<2,500 g], or preterm birth [<37 wk]) in paucigravidae (first or second pregnancy) and maternal or placental plasmodium infection at delivery in multigravidae (third pregnancy or higher). Analysis was by intention to treat. Between 21 July 2011 and 18 March 2013, 1,873 women were recruited (1,155 paucigravidae and 718 multigravidae). The prevalence of adverse live birth outcome was similar in the ISTp-DP (29.9%) and IPTp-SP (28.8%) arms (risk difference = 1.08% [95% CI -3.25% to 5.41%]; all women: relative risk [RR] = 1.04 [95% CI 0.90-1.20], p = 0.625; paucigravidae: RR = 1.10 [95% CI 0.92-1.31], p = 0.282; multigravidae: RR = 0.92 [95% CI 0.71-1.20], p = 0.543). The prevalence of malaria at delivery was higher in the ISTp-DP arm (48.7% versus 40.8%; risk difference = 7.85%, [95% CI 3.07%-12.63%]; all women: RR = 1.19 [95% CI 1.07-1.33], p = 0.007; paucigravidae: RR = 1.16 [95% CI 1.04-1.31], p = 0.011; multigravidae: RR = 1.29 [95% CI 1.02-1.63], p = 0.037). Fetal loss was more common with ISTp-DP (2.6% versus 1.3%; RR = 2.06 [95% CI 1.01-4.21], p = 0.046) and highest among non-DP-recipients (3.1%) in the ISTp-DP arm. Limitations included the open-label design. CONCLUSIONS: Scheduled screening for malaria parasites with the current generation of RDTs three to four times during pregnancy as part of focused antenatal care was not superior to IPTp-SP in this area with high malaria transmission and high SP resistance and was associated with higher fetal loss and more malaria at delivery.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: HIV care and treatment clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. POPULATION: HIV-infected pregnant women. METHODS: Data were collected for all patients enrolled in an HIV/AIDS care and treatment program. Between November 2004 and September 2011, there were 18 917 women pregnant at least once during the follow-up. Thirteen percent of these women had more than one pregnancy, with 21 645 pregnancies occurring. Logistic regression was used to explore the predictors of maternal death among these women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 363 maternal deaths occurred, giving a maternal mortality ratio of 1729 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1553-1905] per 100 000 live births. Being wasted [odds ratio (OR) 3.38, 95% CI 2.58-4.45] or anemic (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.70-3.00) was associated with a higher risk of maternal mortality. Women who were initiated on antiretroviral therapy before their pregnancy had a 55% decreased risk of maternal mortality (95% CI 0.29-0.70) compared with women who were not. The risk of maternal mortality decreased with the length of time on antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, by 8% for each additional month (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal mortality was high among HIV-infected women. Initiating women on antiretroviral therapy as early as possible and providing nutritional interventions during pregnancy should be considered as means to reduce the maternal mortality among these women.","2014-05","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","463-8","","5","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>HIV care and treatment clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania</p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">64&nbsp;296</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tanzania; Maternal Mortality; Time Factors; Tanzania/epidemiology; antiretroviral therapy; Hemoglobins/metabolism; Maternal mortality; Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use; Maternal Age; Sub-Saharan Africa; Anemia/mortality; Diarrhea/mortality; HIV Infections/blood/drug therapy/*mortality; HIV Wasting Syndrome/mortality; HIV/AIDS; nutrition status; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/blood/drug therapy/*mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early identification of clinical factors associated with serious outcomes may help target risk-mitigation strategies. METHODS: Pneumonia cases occurring in the Drakenstein Child Health Study, a prospective birth cohort outside Cape Town, South Africa were analysed, and factors associated with serious outcomes of pneumonia were identified. Pregnant women were enrolled antenatally, followed through pregnancy, and mother-child pairs from birth to 2 years. Active surveillance for pneumonia was done. Children hospitalized with pneumonia had chest radiography and blood drawn for inflammatory markers; course, outcome and duration of hospitalization were investigated. Serious outcomes were defined as in-hospital mortality or admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Prolonged hospitalization was also explored as a proxy for severity. Features associated with serious outcomes or prolonged hospitalization were analysed using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among 1143 live born infants, there were 174 hospitalized pneumonia events in 133 children under 2 years. Three children (1.7%) died, 14 (8%) required ICU admission for respiratory support. In modified Poisson regression, age < 2 months, preterm birth, or hypoxia (oxygen saturation <92%) were significantly associated with serious outcomes. Preterm birth, low birth weight, HIV exposure, stunting, or underweight-for-age (UWFA) were associated with prolonged hospitalization. Chest radiography, elevated C reactive protein, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were not useful to predict death or ICU admission in children hospitalized with pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, death from pneumonia was rare, but clinical features associated with serious outcomes and prolonged hospitalization were identified. These may help with risk stratification, to identify children who may benefit from enhanced monitoring or earlier escalation to respiratory support.","2021","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e0255790","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Western Cape Government Health Department at Paarl Hospital</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted at one health facilities in a peri-urban community outside Cape Town, South Africa.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>1137</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Male; Premature Birth/*epidemiology; Risk Factors; Infant; *Infant, Low Birth Weight; South Africa/epidemiology; C-Reactive Protein/analysis; Growth Disorders/pathology; HIV Infections/complications/diagnosis; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; Intensive Care Units; Oxygen Saturation; Pneumonia/complications/*epidemiology/mortality; Thorax/diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mobile telephone interventions have been used in controlled trials to improve perinatal care, but in this first cohort study of birth outcomes from The Gambia, we report the value of mobile telephone follow-up. Methods: Between December 2012 and November 2015, 1,611 women entered the cohort at their first antenatal visit to be followed through pregnancy and beyond. Potential risk factors for adverse birth outcomes were measured throughout the pregnancy. As many women left the health center within a few hours of delivery, delivered elsewhere, or failed to attend the postnatal clinics, mobile telephone follow-up was used to identify stillbirths and neonatal deaths at 7 and 28 days. Results: The immediate birth outcome was known for 968 women who delivered at the health center (60.1%). The known outcomes at birth improved from 60.1% to 85.2% following telephone calls to women who delivered elsewhere. The known outcomes at 7 days improved from 43.6% to 82.5%, and the known outcomes at 28 days improved from 32.8% to 71.5% following a telephone call. Conclusions: Previous cohort studies of birth outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa have not followed the mothers and babies after leaving the birth facility. This cohort is the first to record birth outcomes up to 28 days after the birth. Mobile telephone communications have made an invaluable contribution in intervention studies. This study has shown that mobile telephone follow-up is also an important tool in an observational study.","2020-01","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">The study was conducted at a single health center in an urban area of The Gambia.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(41, 43, 44)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1,611</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; birth outcome; Gambia; cohort; early neonatal death; mobile telephone; stillbirth; telehealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Every year, 20 million babies are born with low birthweight (LBW), about 96% of which occur in low-income countries. Despite the associated dangers, in about 40%-50% of PTB and LBW cases, the causes remain unexplained. Existing evidence is inconclusive as to whether occupational physical activities such as heavy lifting are implicated. African women bear the transport burden of accessing basic needs for their families. Ghana's PTB rate is 14.5%, whereas the global average is 9.6%. The proposed liftless intervention aims to decrease lifting exposure during pregnancy among Ghanaian women. We hypothesize that a reduction in heavy lifting among pregnant women in Ghana will increase gestational age and birthweight. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the liftless intervention on the incidence of PTB and LBW among pregnant Ghanaian women. METHODS: A cohort stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial in 10 antenatal clinics will be carried out in Ghana. A total of 1000 pregnant participants will be recruited for a 60-week period. To be eligible, the participant should have a singleton pregnancy between 12 and 16 weeks gestation, be attending any of the 10 antenatal clinics, and be exposed to heavy lifting. All participants will receive standard antenatal care within the control phase; by random allocation, two clusters will transit into the intervention phase. The midwife-led 3-component liftless intervention consists of health education, a take-home reminder card mimicking the colors of a traffic light, and a shopping voucher. The primary outcome are gestational ages of <28, 28-32, and 33-37 weeks. The secondary outcomes are LBW (preterm LBW, term but LBW, and postterm), compliance, prevalence of low back and pelvic pain, and premature uterine contractions. Study midwives and participants will not be blinded to the treatment allocation. RESULTS: Permission to conduct the study at all 10 antenatal clinics has been granted by the Ghana Health Service. Application for funding to begin the trial is ongoing. Findings from the main trial are expected to be published by the end of 2019. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, there has been no randomized trial of this nature in Ghana. Minimizing heavy lifting among pregnant African women can reduce the soaring rates of PTB and LBW. The findings will increase the knowledge of the prevention of PTB and LBW worldwide.

Postnatal care is crucial in preventing mortality and improving the health of women and newborns. This prospective cohort study investigated the initiation and utilization of postnatal care at health facilities and explored users' and providers' perspectives on utilization of postnatal care services. METHODS: A sequential explanatory mixed method was used involving women who were followed from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to 3-4 months postnatally in Northwest, Tanzania. From January to December 2018, a door-to-door survey was conducted 3-4 months postnatally among 1385 of these women. A convenience sample of women and community health workers participated in focus group discussions, and traditional birth attendants and nurses participated in key informant interviews to complement quantitative data. Data analyses were conducted using STATA version 13 and NVIVO version 12. STUDY FINDINGS: Approximately, one half of participants attended postnatal care within 42 days after delivery. Postnatal care seeking within 48 h after delivery was reported by 14.6 % of the participants. Women who attended antenatal care at least four times, delivered at health facilities or experienced delivery-related complications were more likely to seek postnatal care. Limited knowledge on the postnatal care services and obstetric complications after childbirth, and not being scheduled for postnatal care by health providers negatively influenced services uptake. Overwhelming workload and shortages of supplies were reported to hinder the provision of postnatal care services. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of postnatal care services remains low in this setting as a result of a number of disparate and complex factors that influence women's choices. Provision of effective postnatal care is hindered by lack of supplies, staffing, and inadequate infrastructure. To ensure accessibility and availability of quality services in this setting, both demand and supply sides factors need to be addressed.","2021-07","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","635","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name: </span></span></strong><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1o&nbsp;de Maio health facility ,Machava &nbsp;health facility</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type:</span></span></strong>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description:</span></span></strong><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Two health centres (1o&nbsp;de Maio and Machava) in Maputo, Mozambique.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size</strong>: 1385</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; *Maternal Health Services; Rural Population; Tanzania; Prenatal Care; Qualitative Research; *Postnatal Care; Health Services Accessibility; Delivery, Obstetric; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Community Health Services; Maternal and child health; Postnatal care; Low-and-middle-income countries; Timing on postnatal care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We performed a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effect of integrating HIV care into ANC clinics in rural Kenya. Twelve facilities were randomized to provide either integrated services (ANC, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and HIV care delivered in the ANC clinic; n = 6 intervention facilities) or standard ANC services (including prevention of mother-to-child transmission and referral to a separate clinic for HIV care; n = 6 control facilities). RESULTS: There were high patient attrition rates over the course of this study. Among study participants who enrolled in HIV care, there was 12-month follow-up data for 256 of 611 (41.8%) women and postpartum data for only 325 of 1172 (28%) women. By 9 months of age, 382 of 568 (67.3%) infants at intervention sites and 338 of 594 (57.0%) at control sites had tested for HIV [odds ratio (OR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71 to 2.82]; 7.3% of infants tested HIV positive at intervention sites compared with 8.0% of infants at control sites (OR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.56 to 1.43). The composite clinical/immunologic progression into AIDS was similar in both arms (4.9% vs. 5.1%, OR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.41 to 1.68). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the provision of integrated services, patient attrition was substantial in both arms, suggesting barriers beyond lack of service integration. Integration of HIV services into the ANC clinic was not associated with a reduced risk of HIV transmission to infants and did not appear to affect short-term maternal health outcomes.","2015-08","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e164-71","","5","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in 12 health facilities in Nyanza Province, Kenya,</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>1172</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; Treatment Outcome; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Cluster Analysis; Kenya/epidemiology; Odds Ratio; Prenatal Care/*organization & administration; Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Community Health Centers/*organization & administration; Health Plan Implementation/*organization & administration; HIV Infections/drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission; Maternal-Child Health Centers/organization & administration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

'Mama kit' incentives - small packages of childcare items provided to mothers conditional on delivering their baby in a facility - may encourage facility delivery. This study measured the impact and cost-effectiveness of a US$4 mama kit on rural facility delivery rates in Zambia. METHODS: A clustered randomised controlled trial was used to measure the impact of mama kits on facility delivery rates in thirty rural health facilities in Serenje and Chadiza districts. Facility-level antenatal care and delivery registers were used to measure the percentage of women attending antenatal care who delivered at a study facility during the intervention period. Results from the trial were then used to model the cost-effectiveness of mama kits at-scale in terms of cost per death averted. RESULTS: The mama kits intervention resulted in a statistically significant increase in facility delivery rates. The multivariate logistic regression found that the mama kits intervention increased the odds of delivering at a facility by 63% (P-value < 0.01, 95% CI: 29%, 106%), or an increase of 9.9 percentage points, yielding a cost-effectiveness of US$5183 per death averted. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation confirms that low-cost mama kits can be a cost-effective intervention to increase facility delivery rates in rural Zambia. Mama kits alone are unlikely to completely solve safe delivery challenges but should be embedded in larger maternal and child health programmes.","2016-04","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","515-24","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted in </span></span><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">30 (10 in Chadiza district </span></span><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">in Eastern Province</span></span><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> and 20 in Serenje district </span></span><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">in Central Province</span></span><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">),</span></span><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> Zambia</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size : </strong>&nbsp;<br>8807</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Rural Population; Logistic Models; *Maternal Health Services; Cost-Benefit Analysis; *Patient Acceptance of Health Care; *Delivery, Obstetric; *Motivation; *Reward; accouchement institutionnel; ensayo aleatorizado y controlado; essai controle randomise; Health Facilities/*statistics & numerical data; incentives; incentivos; incitations; institutional delivery; Maternal Death/prevention & control; maternal health; newborn health; parto hospitalario; Program Evaluation; randomised controlled trial; salud del neonato; salud materna; sante maternelle; sante neonatale; Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maisha is a stigma-based counseling intervention delivered during the first antenatal care (ANC) visit, complementing routine HIV counseling and testing. The goal of Maisha is to promote readiness to initiate and sustain treatment among those who are HIV-positive, and to reduce HIV stigmatizing attitudes among those who test negative. METHODS: A pilot randomized control trial will assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering Maisha in a clinical setting, and the potential efficacy of the intervention on HIV care engagement outcomes (for HIV-positive participants) and HIV stigma constructs (for all participants). A total of 1000 women and approximately 700 male partners will be recruited from two study clinics in the Moshi municipality of Tanzania. Participants will be enrolled at their first ANC visit, prior to HIV testing. It is estimated that 50 women (5%) will be identified as HIV-positive. Following consent and a baseline survey, participants will be randomly assigned to either the control (standard of care) or the Maisha intervention. The Maisha intervention includes a video and counseling session prior to HIV testing, and two additional counseling sessions if the participant tests positive for HIV or has an established HIV diagnosis. A subset of approximately 500 enrolled participants (all HIV-positive participants, and a random selection of HIV-negative participants who have elevated stigma attitude scores) will complete a follow-up assessment at 3 months. Measures will include health outcomes (care engagement, antiretroviral adherence, depression) and HIV stigma outcomes. Quality assurance data will be collected and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be described. Statistical analysis will examine potential differences between conditions in health outcomes and stigma measures, stratified by HIV status. DISCUSSION: ANC provides a unique and important entry point to address HIV stigma. Interventions are needed to improve retention in PMTCT care and to improve community attitudes toward people living with HIV. Results of the Maisha pilot trial will be used to generate parameter estimates and potential ranges of values to estimate power for a full cluster-randomized trial in PMTCT settings, with extended follow-up and enhanced adherence measurement using a biomarker.

Regions with a high incidence of tuberculosis, such as sub-Saharan Africa, are disproportionately burdened by stillbirth and other pregnancy complications. Active tuberculosis increases the risk of pregnancy complications, but the association between latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and pregnancy outcomes is unknown. We explored the effect of latent tuberculosis infection on the risk of stillbirth in women attending antenatal care clinics in Ethiopia, a country with >170 000 annual cases of active tuberculosis. METHOD: Pregnant women were enrolled from antenatal care at three health facilities in Adama, Ethiopia, during 2015-2018, with assessment for previous and current active tuberculosis and testing for LTBI using QuantiFERON-TB-GOLD-PLUS. Proportions of stillbirth (>/= 20 weeks of gestation) and neonatal death (< 29 days of birth) were compared with respect to categories of maternal tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis-uninfected, LTBI, previous-, and current active tuberculosis). Multivariable logistic regression was performed for stillbirth. RESULTS: Among 1463 participants enrolled, the median age was 25 years, 10.2% were HIV-positive, 34.6% were primigravidae, and the median gestational age at inclusion was 18 weeks. Four (0.3%) were diagnosed with active tuberculosis during pregnancy, 68 (4.6%) reported previous treatment for active tuberculosis, 470 (32.1%) had LTBI, and 921 (63.0%) were tuberculosis-uninfected. Stillbirth was more frequent in participants with LTBI compared to tuberculosis-uninfected participants, although not reaching statistical significance (19/470, 4.0% vs 25/921, 2.7%, adjusted [for age, gravidity and HIV serostatus] odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 0.73-2.57, p = 0.30). Rates of neonatal death (5/470, 1.1% vs 10/921, 1.1%) were similar between these categories. CONCLUSION: Latent tuberculosis infection was not significantly associated with stillbirth or neonatal death in this cohort. Studies based on larger cohorts and with details on causes of stillbirth, as well as other pregnancy outcomes, are needed to further investigate this issue.","2022","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e0261972","","4","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Adama Hospital Medical College, Adama Health Centre, Geda Health Centre</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facility</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted in Adama city, Ethiopia</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size : </strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>2085</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Pregnancy Complications; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Stillbirth/epidemiology; *Perinatal Death; Ethiopia/epidemiology; *Latent Tuberculosis/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology; *Tuberculosis/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To establish whether a trial on the impact of routine Doppler screening in a low-risk obstetric population is warranted, we determined the prevalence of abnormal fetal umbilical artery resistance indices among low-risk pregnant women using a low-cost Doppler device in five LMICs. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, prospective cohort study in Ghana, India, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa. Trained nurses or midwives performed a single, continuous-wave Doppler screening using the Umbiflow device for low-risk pregnant women (according to local guidelines) between 28 and 34 weeks' gestation. We assessed the prevalence of abnormal (raised) resistance index (RI), including absent end diastolic flow (AEDF), and compared pregnancy and health service utilisation outcomes between women with abnormal RI versus those with normal RI. RESULTS: Of 7151 women screened, 495 (6.9%) had an abnormal RI, including 14 (0.2%) with AEDF. Caesarean section (40.8% vs 28.1%), labour induction (20.5% vs 9.0%) and low birth weight (<2500 g) (15.0% vs 6.8%) were significantly more frequent among women with abnormal RI compared with women with normal RI. Abnormal RI was associated with lower birth weights across all weight centiles. Stillbirth and perinatal mortality rates were similar between women with normal and abnormal RI. CONCLUSION: A single Doppler screening of low-risk pregnant women in LMICs using the Umbiflow device can detect a large number of fetuses at risk of growth restriction and consequent adverse perinatal outcomes. Many perinatal deaths could potentially be averted with appropriate intervention strategies.

DESIGN: We conducted an unblinded 1:1 cluster-randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 48 health facilities in Siaya County, Kenya were randomised. The trial ran from May 2017 to December 2019. PARTICIPANTS: 2922 women were recruited to the control and 2522 to the intervention arm. INTERVENTIONS: An electronic system recorded attendance and triggered payments to the participant's mobile for the intervention arm (US$4.5), and phone credit for the control arm (US$0.5). Eligibility criteria were resident in the catchment area and access to a mobile phone. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were any ANC, delivery, any PNC between 4 and 12 months after delivery, childhood immunisation and referral attendance to other facilities for ANC or PNC. Given problems with the electronic system, primary outcomes were obtained from maternal clinic books if participants brought them to data extraction meetings (1257 (50%) of intervention and 1053 (36%) control arm participants). Attendance at referrals to other facilities is not reported because of limited data. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher proportion of appointments attended for ANC (67% vs 60%, adjusted OR (aOR) 1.90; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.66) and child immunisation (88% vs 85%; aOR 1.74; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.77) in intervention than control arm. No intervention effect was seen considering delivery at the facility (90% vs 92%; aOR 0.58; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.33) and any PNC attendance (82% vs 81%; aOR 1.25; 95% CI 0.74 to 2.10) separately. The pooled OR across all attendance types was 1.64 (1.28 to 2.10). CONCLUSIONS: Demand-side financing incentives, such as CCTs, can improve attendance for appointments. However, attention needs to be paid to the technology, the barriers that remain for delivery at facility and PNC visits and encouraging women to attend ANC visits within the recommended WHO timeframe.

METHODS: Secondary analysis of data for 2,149 women included in a community based randomized placebo controlled trial for the prevention of preterm birth (APPLe trial (ISRCTN84023116) with gestational age at birth determined through ultrasound measurement in early pregnancy. Multivariate Logistic Regression analyses to obtain models for three outcome variables: all preterm, early preterm, and late preterm birth. FINDINGS: No statistical differences were noted for the prevalence of HIV infection (p = 0.30) or syphilis (p = 0.12) between women who delivered preterm versus term. BMI (Adjusted OR 0.91 (0.85-0.97); p = 0.005) and weight gain (Adjusted OR 0.89 (0.82-0.97); p = 0.006) had an independent, protective effect. Previous preterm birth doubled the odds of preterm birth (Adjusted OR 2.13 (1.198-3.80); p = 0.01). Persistent malaria (despite malaria prophylaxis) increased the risk of late preterm birth (Adjusted OR 1.99 (1.05-3.79); p = 0.04). Age <20 (Adjusted OR 1.73 (1.03-2.90); p = 0.04) and anemia (Adjusted OR 1.95 (1.08-3.52); p = 0.03) were associated with early preterm birth (<34 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: Despite claims that HIV infection is an important cause of preterm birth in Africa, we found no evidence of an association in this population (unexposed to anti-retroviral treatment). Persistent malaria was associated with late preterm birth. Maternal undernourishment and anemia were independently associated with early preterm birth. The study did not assess whether the link was direct or whether a common precursor such as chronic infection was responsible for both maternal effects and early labour.","2014","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e90128","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Conducted in</span></span><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white""> </span></span></strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">4 health facilities</span></span><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">, </span></span></strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">T</span></span><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">hree rural and one Peri-urban health centers in Sourthern malawi</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Sample size : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">2297</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Malawi; Multivariate Analysis; Malaria/complications; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; HIV Infections/*complications; Obstetric Labor, Premature/*etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PARTICIPANTS: Data were pooled on 14 635 singleton, live birth pregnancies from women who had participated in 1 of 13 pregnancy studies. The 13 studies cover 8 countries in Africa and Papua New Guinea in the Western Pacific conducted from 1996 to 2015. FINDINGS TO DATE: Data are available at the time of antenatal enrolment of women into their respective parent study and at delivery. The data set comprises essential data such as malaria infection status, anthropometric assessments of maternal nutritional status, presence of anaemia and birth weight, as well as additional variables such gestational age at delivery for a subset of women. Participating studies are described in detail with regard to setting and primary outcome measures, and summarised data are available from each contributing cohort. FUTURE PLANS: This pooled birth cohort is the largest pregnancy data set to date to permit a more definite evaluation of the impact of plausible interactions between poor nutritional status and malaria infection in pregnant women on fetal growth and gestational length. Given the current comparative lack of large pregnancy cohorts in malaria-endemic settings, compilation of suitable pregnancy cohorts is likely to provide adequate statistical power to assess malaria-nutrition interactions, and could point towards settings where such interactions are most relevant. The M3 cohort may thus help to identify pregnant women at high risk of adverse outcomes who may benefit from tailored intensive antenatal care including nutritional supplements and alternative or intensified malaria prevention regimens, and the settings in which these interventions would be most effective.","2016-12","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e012697","","12","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name: &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Adama Hospital Medical College , Adama Health Cen tre, Geda Health Centre</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Health facilities and communities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">conducted in</span></span></p> <ol> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Benin</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Burkina Faso</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Ghana</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Kenya</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Malawi</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Papua New Guinea</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Tanzania</span></span> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>13995</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Pregnancy Complications; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; *pregnancy; Male; Prenatal Care; Africa; *malaria; *Nutritional Status; Malaria/*complications; *Gestational Age; *Fetal Development; *malnutrition; Datasets as Topic; Malnutrition/*complications; Papua New Guinea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, malaria control measures consisting of indoor residual spraying and specific antimalarial treatment have been in place since the 1970s. Information on the burden of malaria in pregnancy in South Africa is needed to indicate whether a specific policy for malaria prevention in pregnancy is necessary. OBJECTIVE: To determine the burden of malaria in pregnancy in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, South Africa. METHODS: Pregnant women were enrolled at their first antenatal care visit to three health facilities in Umkhanyakude health district in northern KZN during May 2004 - September 2005 and followed up until delivery. Data collection included demographic details, current and previous malaria infection during pregnancy, haemoglobin concentrations and birth outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1 406 study participants, more than a quarter were younger than 20 years of age, and more than 90% were unemployed and unmarried. Although 33.2% of the women were anaemic, this was not related to malaria. The prevalence and incidence of malaria were very low, and low birth weight was only weakly associated with malaria (1/10). CONCLUSION: The low burden of malaria in these pregnant women suggests that they have benefited from malaria control strategies in the study area. The implication is that additional measures specific for malaria prevention in pregnancy are not required. However, ongoing monitoring is needed to ensure that malaria prevalence remains low.","2013-01","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","172-5","","3","103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: South Africa","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Three health facilities in Umkhanyakude health district in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, South Africa.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1 406</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome/epidemiology; Prevalence; Drug Combinations; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa/epidemiology; Adolescent; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Antimalarials/therapeutic use; Pyrimethamine/*therapeutic use; Sulfadoxine/*therapeutic use; control; numerical data; *Communicable Disease Control/methods/organization & administration/statistics &; *Insecticides; *Malaria, Falciparum/drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention &; Plasmodium falciparum/*drug effects/isolation & purification; Prenatal Care/methods/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This necessitates increased focus on the pregnancy and early post-natal periods, developing and scaling up appropriate models of community-based care, especially to reach the peri-urban poor. METHODS: We used a randomised controlled trial with 30 clusters (15 in each arm) to evaluate an integrated, scalable package providing two pregnancy visits and five post-natal home visits delivered by community health workers in Umlazi, Durban, South Africa. Primary outcomes were exclusive and appropriate infant feeding at 12 weeks post-natally and HIV-free infant survival. RESULTS: At 12 weeks of infant age, the intervention was effective in almost doubling the rate of exclusive breastfeeding (risk ratio 1.92; 95% CI: 1.59-2.33) and increasing infant weight and length-for-age z-scores (weight difference 0.09; 95% CI: 0.00-0.18, length difference 0.11; 95% CI: 0.03-0.19). No difference was seen between study arms in HIV-free survival. Women in the intervention arm were also more likely to take their infant to the clinic within the first week of life (risk ratio 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04-1.18). CONCLUSIONS: The trial coincided with national scale up of ARVs for PMTCT, and this could have diluted the effect of the intervention on HIV-free survival. We have demonstrated that implementation of a pro-poor integrated PMTCT and maternal, neonatal and child health home visiting model is feasible and effective. This trial could inform national primary healthcare reengineering strategies in favour of home visits. The dose effect on exclusive breastfeeding is notable as improving exclusive breastfeeding has been resistant to change in other studies targeting urban poor families.","2014-03","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","256-266","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Umlazi</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Communities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>: </strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in Umlazi, a periurban settlement near Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>3,957</p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Poverty; Child, Preschool; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; South Africa; South Africa/epidemiology; Adolescent; Cluster Analysis; Infant Mortality; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV; *Community Health Workers; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Program Evaluation; Survival Rate; Linear Models; Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data; newborn; *Community Health Services; community health worker; community-based; Depression, Postpartum/epidemiology; HIV Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission; House Calls; integrated; Maternal Health Services/*methods; post-natal care; prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT); primary health care; Urban Population/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a major concern in developing countries, including Ethiopia. This study tried to identify predictors of adverse neonatal outcomes at selected public hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia. A hospital-based prospective follow-up study was conducted in three public hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia from June to October 2020. A total of 2,246 laboring women and neonates born at the hospitals were enrolled in the study. Data were collected through interviews, observation checklists, and clinical chart review. Reports were presented in relative risks with 95% CIs. The overall magnitude of adverse neonatal outcome was 20.97% (95% CI: 19.33- 22.71%). It was 24.3% for babies born through cesarean section (95% CI: 21.3%, 27.5). The presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid increased the risk for neonates delivered via cesarean section (ARR, 1.52 95% CI; 1.04, 2.22). Among neonates born via vaginal delivery, the risk of adverse neonatal outcome was higher among nullipara women (ARR, 1.42 95% CI; 1.02, 1.99) and among women diagnosed with abnormal labor or pregnancy such as APH, pre-eclampsia, obstructed labor, fetal distress, and mal-presentation at admission (ARR, 1.30 95%CI; 1.01, 1.67). The risk of adverse neonatal outcome was higher among babies born through the cesarian section than those born via vaginal delivery. Abnormal labor or pregnancy and being primiparous increased the risk of adverse neonatal outcome in vaginal delivery.","2021","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","2333794X211018350","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">&nbsp;</span></span></strong>Hiwot Fana Hospital, Jegal Hospital, Dil Chora Hospital, Bisidimo Hospital</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Public hospitals, specialized hospital, referral hospital, general/secondary hospitals, primary hospitals</p> <p><strong>Sample Size : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p> <p>2042</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; adverse neonatal outcomes; cesarean section; Eastern Ethiopia; vaginal delivery (natural delivery)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Zambia, where many women engage in early sexual behaviour or marry at a young age, 28.5% of girls aged 15-19 years were pregnant with their first child in the year 2013-2014. This study sought to explore associations between maternal age and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women in Lusaka, Zambia. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data nested within a larger population-based prospective cohort study which was implemented in three government health facilities-two first level hospitals and one clinic in Lusaka, Zambia. Women presenting to the study sites for antenatal care were enrolled into the study and followed up for collection of maternal and neonatal outcomes at 7, 28 and 42 days postpartum. The study's primary outcomes were the incidence of maternal and newborn complications and factors associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Statistical significance was evaluated at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: The study included 11,501 women, 15.6% of whom were adolescents aged 10-19 years. Generally, adolescence did not have statistically significant associations with poor maternal health outcomes. However, the risk of experiencing obstructed labour, premature rupture of membranes and postpartum hemorrhage was higher among adolescents than women aged 20-24 years while the risk of severe infection was lower and non-significant. Adolescents also had 1.36 times the odds of having a low birthweight baby (95% CI 1.12, 1.66) and were at risk of preterm birth (aOR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.06, 1.84). Their newborns were in need of bag and mask resuscitation at birth (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.41, 0.93). Advanced maternal age was significantly associated with increased odds of hypertension/ pre-eclampsia (95% CI 1.54, 5.89) and preterm labour (aOR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.24, 6.21). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescence is a risk factor for selected pregnancy outcomes in urban health facilities in Lusaka, Zambia. Health care workers should intensify the provision of targeted services to improve neonatal health outcomes.

Intermittent screening with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and treatment of positive women (ISTp) is an alternative approach. METHODS AND FINDINGS: An open, individually randomized, non-inferiority trial of IPTp-SP versus ISTp was conducted in 5,354 primi- or secundigravidae in four West African countries with a low prevalence of resistance to SP (The Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana). Women in the IPTp-SP group received SP on two or three occasions whilst women in the ISTp group were screened two or three times with a RDT and treated if positive for malaria with artemether-lumefantrine (AL). ISTp-AL was non-inferior to IPTp-SP in preventing low birth weight (LBW), anemia and placental malaria, the primary trial endpoints. The prevalence of LBW was 15.1% and 15.6% in the IPTp-SP and ISTp-AL groups respectively (OR = 1.03 [95% CI: 0.88, 1.22]). The mean hemoglobin concentration at the last clinic attendance before delivery was 10.97g/dL and 10.94g/dL in the IPTp-SP and ISTp-AL groups respectively (mean difference: -0.03 g/dL [95% CI: -0.13, +0.06]). Active malaria infection of the placenta was found in 24.5% and in 24.2% of women in the IPTp-SP and ISTp-AL groups respectively (OR = 0.95 [95% CI 0.81, 1.12]). More women in the ISTp-AL than in the IPTp-SP group presented with malaria parasitemia between routine antenatal clinics (310 vs 182 episodes, rate difference: 49.4 per 1,000 pregnancies [95% CI 30.5, 68.3], but the number of hospital admissions for malaria was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite low levels of resistance to SP in the study areas, ISTp-AL performed as well as IPTp-SP. In the absence of an effective alternative medication to SP for IPTp, ISTp-AL is a potential alternative to IPTp in areas where SP resistance is high. It may also have a role in areas where malaria transmission is low and for the prevention of malaria in HIV positive women receiving cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in whom SP is contraindicated.

Observational studies indicate that adults infected with HIV with low vitamin D status may be at increased risk of mortality, pulmonary tuberculosis, and HIV disease progression. Growing observational evidence also suggests that low vitamin D status in pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth and infant health outcomes. As a result, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adjunct vitamin D3 supplementation may improve the health of HIV-infected pregnant women and their children. METHODS/DESIGN: The Trial of Vitamins-5 (ToV5) is an individually randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of maternal vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation conducted among 2300 HIV-infected pregnant women receiving triple-drug ART under Option B+ in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. HIV-infected pregnant women of 12-27 weeks gestation are randomized to either: 1) 3000 IU vitamin D3 taken daily from randomization in pregnancy until trial discharge at 12 months postpartum; or 2) a matching placebo regimen. Maternal participants are followed-up at monthly clinic visits during pregnancy, at delivery, and then with their children at monthly postpartum clinic visits. The primary efficacy outcomes of the trial are: 1) maternal HIV disease progression or death; 2) risk of small-for-gestational age (SGA) births; and 3) risk of infant stunting at 1 year of age. The primary safety outcome of the trial is incident maternal hypercalcemia. Secondary outcomes include a range of clinical and biological maternal and child health outcomes. DISCUSSION: The ToV5 will provide causal evidence on the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on HIV progression and death, SGA births, and infant stunting at 1 year of age. The results of the trial are likely generalizable to HIV-infected pregnant women and their children in similar resource-limited settings utilizing the Option B+ approach.

Global health","","2214-109X (Linking)","10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00026-2","","BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, administration of hepatitis B virus (HBV) birth-dose vaccines remains suboptimal. Evidence is scarce on whether African countries should focus on increasing vaccine coverage or developing strategies incorporating additional measures, such as peripartum antiviral prophylaxis to pregnant women at high risk. To better inform decision makers, we estimated the residual risk of mother-to-child transmission despite HBV birth-dose vaccine in Cameroon. METHODS: We did a single-centre, longitudinal observational study. Pregnant women were systematically screened for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) at Tokombere District Hospital (Tokombere district, Cameroon). Children born to HBsAg-positive mothers in 2009-16 who received the HBV birth-dose vaccine and three subsequent doses of pentavalent vaccine at 6, 10, and 14 weeks were followed up prospectively in 2015-17. In children, capillary blood was obtained for HBsAg rapid test and dried blood spots to quantify HBV DNA concentrations. Venous blood was also collected from HBsAg-positive children. Mother-to-child transmission was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. FINDINGS: Between Jan 31, 2009, and Dec 31, 2016, 22 243 (66.8%) of 33 309 pregnant women accepted antenatal HBV screening, of whom 3901 (17.5%) were HBsAg positive. 2004 (51.4%) of 3901 children who were born to HBsAg-positive mothers received the HBV birth-dose vaccine, of whom 1800 (89.8%) also completed the three-dose pentavalent vaccine. In total, the current analysis included 607 children who had a follow-up serosurvey. The prevalence of HBsAg was 5.6% in children who received the birth-dose vaccine in less than 24 h, 7.0% in those who received it 24-47 h after birth, and 16.7% in those who received it 48-96 h after birth (ptrend=0.083). 35 (89.7%) of 39 infected children were born to mothers positive for HBV e antigen with high HBV DNA of 5.3 log10 IU/mL or more. Whole-genome sequencing of HBV in infected mother-child pairs confirmed high identity proportions of 99.97-100%. INTERPRETATION: We documented a substantial risk of mother-to-child transmission despite timely administration of the HBV birth-dose vaccine within 24 h after birth. To reach WHO's elimination targets, peripartum antiviral prophylaxis might be required in parts of Africa, in addition to increasing coverage of the HBV birth-dose vaccine.

Successful control of malaria in pregnancy could save lives of mothers and babies and is an essential part of antenatal care in endemic areas. The primary objective is to determine the protective efficacy of community-scheduled screening and treatment (CSST) using community health workers (CHW) against the primary outcome of prevalence of placental malaria. The secondary objectives are to determine the protective efficacy of CSST on maternal anaemia, maternal peripheral infection, low birth weight, selection of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance markers, and on antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance and coverage of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP). METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multi-centre cluster-randomised controlled trial involving three countries with varying malaria endemicity; low (The Gambia) versus high transmission (Burkina Faso and Benin), and varying degrees of SP resistance (high in Benin and moderate in Gambia and Burkina Faso). CHW and their related catchment population who are randomised into the intervention arm will receive specific training on community-based case management of malaria in pregnancy. All women in both study arms will be enrolled at their first ANC visits in their second trimester where they will receive their first dose of IPTp-SP. Thereafter, CHW in the intervention arm will perform scheduled monthly screening and treatment in the womens homes. At time of delivery, a placental biopsy will be collected from all women to determine placental malaria. At each contact point, filter paper and blood slides will be collected for detection of malaria infection and SP resistance markers. DISCUSSION: To reach successful global malaria control, there is an urgent need to access those at greatest risk of malaria infection. The project is designed to develop a low-cost intervention in pregnant women which will have an immediate impact on the malaria burden in resource-limited countries. This will be done by adding to the standard IPTp-SP delivered through the health facilities: an ""extension"" strategy to the communities in rural areas thus bringing health services closer to where women live.

We assessed the impact of maternal HAART on HIV-free survival of breastfed infants in Malawi. METHODS: The post-exposure prophylaxis of infants-Malawi trial (2004-2009) enrolled mothers/infants during labor or immediately post-partum to evaluate 14-week extended infant antiretroviral prophylaxis for preventing HIV transmission through breastfeeding. Mothers meeting national HAART guidelines were referred for therapy. Child HIV-free survival-survival without HIV infection-was compared by maternal HAART status. RESULTS: Overall, 3022 mother-infant pairs contributed 4214 infant/person-years (PY) at-risk for HIV infection or death, with 532 events (incidence 12.6/100 PY, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 11.6-13.7). During follow-up, 349 mothers were HAART initiated; 581 remained HAART naive with CD4 cell counts <250 cells/mm(3), and 2092 were never HAART-eligible. By 3 months, 11 % of infants with HAART naive mothers (CD4 < 250) were infected with HIV or died versus 7 % of infants of HAART-initiated mothers and 4 % of infants of HAART-ineligible mothers. Maternal HAART was associated with a 46 % reduction in infant HIV infection or death as compared to infants with HAART naive mothers (CD4 < 250) (adjusted hazards ratio 0.54, 95 % CI 0.36-0.81). Among HIV-exposed, uninfected infants, breastfeeding, but not HAART, was significantly associated with decreased child mortality. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection and mortality are high during the first 3 months post-partum in infants of mothers with advanced HIV, and rapid maternal HAART initiation can significantly improve HIV-related infant outcomes.

METHODS: We studied the effect of group antenatal care on gestational age at birth among women in Rwanda, hypothesizing that participation would increase mean gestational length. For this unblinded cluster randomized trial, 36 health centers were pair-matched and randomized; half continued individual antenatal care (control), half implemented group antenatal care (intervention). Women who initiated antenatal care between May 2017 and December 2018 were invited to participate, and included in analyses if they presented before 24 weeks gestation, attended at least two visits, and their birth outcome was obtained. We used a generalized estimating equations model for analysis. FINDINGS: In total, 4091 women in 18 control clusters and 4752 women in 18 intervention clusters were included in the analysis. On average, women attended three total antenatal care visits. Gestational length was equivalent in the intervention and control groups (39.3 weeks (SD 1.6) and 39.3 weeks (SD 1.5)). There were no significant differences between groups in secondary outcomes except that more women in control sites attended postnatal care visits (40.1% versus 29.7%, p = 0.003) and more women in intervention sites attended at least three total antenatal care visits (80.7% versus 71.7%, p = 0.003). No harms were observed. INTERPRETATION: Group antenatal care did not result in a difference in gestational length between groups. This may be due to the low intervention dose. We suggest studies of both the effectiveness and costs of higher doses of group antenatal care among women at higher risk of preterm birth. We observed threats to group care due to facility staff shortages; we recommend studies in which antenatal care providers are exclusively allocated to group antenatal care during visits.

As HIV testing and linkage to PMTCT occurs in antenatal care (ANC), major challenges for any PMTCT option in developing countries, including Tanzania, are delays in the first ANC visit and a low overall number of visits. Community health workers (CHWs) have been effective in various settings in increasing the uptake of clinical services and improving treatment retention and adherence. At the beginning of this trial in January 2013, the World Health Organization recommended either of two medication regimens, Option A or B, for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). It is still largely unclear which option is more effective when implemented in a public healthcare system. This study aims to determine the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of: (1) a community health worker (CWH) intervention and (2) PMTCT Option B in improving ANC and PMTCT outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a cluster-randomized controlled health systems implementation trial with a two-by-two factorial design. All 60 administrative wards in the Kinondoni and Ilala districts in Dar es Salaam were first randomly allocated to either receiving the CHW intervention or not, and then to receiving either Option B or A. Under the standard of care, facility-based health workers follow up on patients who have missed scheduled appointments for PMTCT, first through a telephone call and then with a home visit. In the wards receiving the CHW intervention, the CHWs: (1) identify pregnant women through home visits and refer them to antenatal care; (2) provide education to pregnant women on antenatal care, PMTCT, birth, and postnatal care; (3) routinely follow up on all pregnant women to ascertain whether they have attended ANC; and (4) follow up on women who have missed ANC or PMTCT appointments.

However, there is little research on the prevalence of practices that might constitute mistreatment of neonates. This study aims to describe the care received by neonates up to 2 h after birth in a sample of three countries in west Africa. METHODS: Data from this multicountry, facility-based, observational study were collected on 15 neonatal care practices across nine facilities in Ghana, Guinea, and Nigeria, as part of WHO's wider multicountry study on how women are treated during childbirth. Women were eligible if they were admitted to the participating health facilities for childbirth, in early established labour or active labour, aged 15 years or older, and provided written informed consent on behalf of themselves and their neonate. All labour observations were continuous, one-to-one observations of women and neonates by independent data collectors. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine associations between these neonatal care practices, maternal and neonate characteristics, and maternal mistreatment. Early neonate deaths, stillbirths, and higher order multiple births were excluded from analysis. FINDINGS: Data collection took place from Sept 19, 2016, to Feb 26, 2017, in Nigeria; from Aug 1, 2017, to Jan 18, 2018, in Ghana; and from July 1 to Oct 30, 2017, in Guinea. We included data for 362 women-neonate dyads (356 [98%] with available data for neonatal care practices) in Nigeria, 760 (749 [99%]) in Ghana, and 558 (522 [94%]) in Guinea. Delayed cord clamping was done for most neonates (1493 [91.8%] of 1627); other practices, such as skin-to-skin contact, were less commonly done (1048 [64.4%]). During the first 2 h after birth, separation of the mother and neonate occurred in 844 (51.9%) of 1627 cases; and was more common for mothers who were single (adjusted odds ratio [AOR; adjusting for country, maternal age, education, marital status, neonate weight at birth, and neonate sex] 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.6) than those who were married or cohabiting. Lack of maternal education was associated with increased likelihood of neonates not receiving recommended breastfeeding practices. Neonates with a low birthweight (<2.5 kg) were more likely (1.7, 1.1-2.8) to not begin breastfeeding on demand than full weight neonates. When women experienced physical abuse from providers within 1 h before childbirth, their neonates were more likely to be slapped (AOR 1.9, 1.1-3.9). INTERPRETATION: A high proportion of neonates did not receive recommended care practices, and some received practices that might constitute mistreatment. Further research is needed on understanding and measuring mistreatment to improve care, including respectful care, for mothers and neonates.

We analyzed data on pregnant women and their partners' self-assessment on the usability of kits delivered by their pregnant women. METHODS: Quantitative data were collected on 399 pregnant women and 238 male partners enrolled in the intervention arm of a large cluster-randomized HIVST trial. Each pregnant woman received HIVST demonstrations, detailed pictorial instructions on how to use OraQuick HIVST kits, and two kits; for herself and her male partner. Follow-up was at one month (baseline for male partners) and 3 months. Descriptive statistics were conducted to compare understanding and following of HIVST instructions by age and education level. RESULTS: The proportion of those who understood HIVST instructions was almost the same (98%) for women and their partners, although partners (26.5%) were nearly twice as likely than women (16.0%) to report needing pretest counseling (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.27-2.79). Partners' understanding of the HIVST instructions did not vary by education level, but 4.4% of women with primary education reported difficulty in understanding HIVST instructions compared with 0.5% and 0% of those with secondary and university education, respectively (p = 0.05). However, 5.6% of women aged 30-68 years and 3.3% of partners aged 20-24 years found it more difficult to understand the HIVST instructions. CONCLUSION: Both pregnant women and their male partners were correctly able to perform an HIVST without or (with minimal) support suggesting that this mode of delivery will help the national program reach more men. Because more male partners than women required HIVST pretest counseling support, male-targeted HIVST promotional messages may be needed to increase men's self-efficacy to perform HIVST unsupported.","2021-06","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","629-637","","7","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name : &nbsp;</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">health facilities</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Uganda</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>1514</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Male; Uganda; Mass Screening; Sexual Partners; Cross-Sectional Studies; *Pregnant Women; *sub-Saharan Africa; *antenatal care; *Uganda; *pregnant women; *HIV self-testing; *HIV Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology; *male partner; *OraQuick kits; *understanding instructions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the key drivers of maternal mortality in Ethiopia is the very low coverage of Skilled Birth attendance (SBA) in rural Ethiopia. This cluster randomized trial piloted an innovative approach of deploying trained community reproductive nurses (CORN) to hard to reach/unreachable rural Ethiopia to improve the coverage of SBA. METHODS: We used a three-arm cluster randomized trial to test the effect of deploying CORN in rural communities in South Ethiopia to improve SBA and other maternal health indicators. A total of 282 villages/clusters (94 from each arm) were randomly selected in the three districts of the zone for the study. The intervention was implemented in four consecutive phases that aimed at of provision of essential maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH) services mainly focusing on SBA. The CORN were trained and deployed in health centres (arm 1) and in the community/health posts (arm2). A third arm (arm 3) consisting control villages without the intervention. A baseline and end line assessment was conducted to compare the difference in the proportion of SBA and other MNCH service uptake across the three arms Data was entered into computer, edited, cleaned, and analyzed using Epi-data statistical software. The presentation followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement guidelines for cluster-randomized trials. DISCUSSION: This trial is designed to test the impact of an innovative and newly designed means of distribution for the national health extension program strategy with additional service package with no change to the target population. The focus is on effect of CORN in revitalizing the Health Extension Program (HEP) through improving SBA service uptake and other maternal health service uptake indicators. The study findings may guide national policy to strengthen and shape the already existing HEP that has certain limitations to improve maternal health indicators. The competency based training methodology could provide feedback for health science colleges to improve the national nursing or midwifery training curriculum.

Newborn death contributes for about 38% of all under five deaths. This study has identified the magnitude and independent predictors of neonatal mortality in rural Ethiopia. METHODS: This population based nested case control study was conducted in rural West Gojam zone, Northern Ethiopia, among a cohort of pregnant women who gave birth between March 2011 and Feb 2012. The cohort was established by Maternal and Newborn Health in Ethiopia Partnership (MaNHEP) project in 2010 by recruiting mothers in their third trimester, as identified by trained community volunteers. Once identified, women stayed in the cohort throughout their pregnancy period receiving Community Maternal and Newborn Health (CMNH) training by health extension workers and community volunteers till the end of the first 48 hours postpartum. Cases were 75 mothers who lost their newborns to neonatal death and controls were 150 randomly selected mothers with neonates who survived the neonatal period. Data to identify cause of death were collected using the WHO standard verbal autopsy questionnaire after the culturally appropriate 40 days of bereavement period. Binomial logistic regression model was used to identify independent contributors to neonatal mortality. RESULT: The neonatal mortality rate was AOR(95%CI) = 18.6 (14.8, 23.2) per 1000 live births. Neonatal mortality declined with an increase in family size, neonates who were born among a family of more than two had lesser odds of death in the neonatal period than those who were born in a family of two AOR (95% CI) = 0.13 (0.02, 0.71). Mothers who gave birth to 2-4 AOR(95%CI) = 0.15 (0.05, 0.48) and 5+ children AOR(95%CI) = 0.08 (0.02, 0.26) had lesser odds of losing their newborns to neonatal mortality. Previous history of losing a newborn to neonatal death also increased the odds of neonatal mortality during the last birth AOR (95%CI) = 0.25 (0.11, 0.53). CONCLUSION: The neonatal mortality rate in our study was three times lower than the regional neonatal mortality rate estimate, indicating community based interventions could significantly decrease neonatal mortality. The identified determinants, which are amenable for change, emphasize the need to improve quality of care during pregnancy, labour and delivery to improve pregnancy outcome.","2017","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","e0172875","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)"">Location Type :</span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)"">Description :</span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in three districts of the West Gojam zone in Ethiopia: North Achefer, South Achefer, and Mecha. 24 kebeles (the smallest administrative unit) were selected for the study.

This study explored the longitudinal relationship of maternal depressive symptoms and other selected psychosocial factors with infant feeding practices (IFPs) in rural Ethiopia using summary IFP index. METHODS: This study uses existing data from the ENGINE birth cohort study, conducted from March 2014 to March 2016 in three districts in the southwest of Ethiopia. A total of 4680 pregnant women were recruited and data were collected once during pregnancy (twice for those in the first trimester), at birth, and then every 3 months until the child was 12 months old. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect data on IFPs, maternal depressive symptoms, household food insecurity, intimate partner violence (IPV), maternal social support, active social participation, and other sociodemographic variables. A composite measure of IFP index was computed using 14 WHO recommended infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practice indicators. High IFP index indicated best practice. Prenatal and postnatal maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Linear multilevel mixed effects model was fitted to assess longitudinal relationship of IFPs with maternal depression and other psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Reports of higher postnatal depressive symptoms (ss = - 1.03, P = 0.001) and IPV (ss = - 0.21, P = 0.001) were associated with lower scores on the IFP index. Whereas, reports of better maternal social support (ss = 0.11, P = 0.002) and active social participation (ss = 0.55, P < 0.001) were associated with higher scores on the IFP index. Contrary to expectations, moderate household food insecurity (ss = 0.84, P = 0.003), severe household food insecurity (ss = 1.03, P = 0.01) and infant morbidity episodes (ss = 0.63, P = 0.013) were associated with higher scores on the IFP index. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a multitude of factors are related to IFPs and hence coordinated, multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder interventions including maternal depressive symptoms screening and management are needed to improve infant feeding practices.","2021-03","2024-01-16 12:27:56","2024-01-16 12:27:56","","27","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Community</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Conducted in 117 clusters across the three districts three districts (Woliso, Tiro-Afeta, and Gomma) in the Southwestern part of Ethiopia.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">4680</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Infant; Rural Population; Child; Ethiopia/epidemiology; *Ethiopia; *Social support; *Depression, Postpartum/epidemiology/etiology; *Depression/epidemiology/etiology; *Household food insecurity; *Infant feeding practices; *Intimate partner violence; *Postnatal depression; *Prenatal depression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Progress has been slow because routine antenatal care has focused only on women. Yet, in Uganda, many women first want the approval of their husbands. The World Health Organization recommends postpartum family planning (PPFP) as a critical component of health care. The aim of this trial is to test the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants in a trial of a complex community-based intervention to provide counselling to antenatal couples in Uganda. METHODS: This is a two-group, non-blinded cluster-randomised controlled feasibility trial of a complex intervention. Primary health centres in Uganda will be randomised to receive the intervention or usual care provided by the Ministry of Health. The intervention consists of training village health teams to provide basic counselling to couples at home, encouraging men to accompany their wives to an antenatal clinic, and secondly of training health workers to provide information and counselling to couples at antenatal clinics, to facilitate shared decision-making on the most appropriate place of delivery, and postpartum contraception. We aim to recruit 2 health centres in each arm, each with 10 village health teams, each of whom will aim to recruit 35 pregnant women (a total of 700 women per arm). The village health teams will follow up and collect data on pregnant women in the community up to 12 months after delivery and will directly enter the data using the COSMOS software on a smartphone. DISCUSSION: This intervention addresses two key avoidable factors in maternal, perinatal and neonatal deaths (lack of family planning and inappropriate place of delivery). Determining the acceptability and feasibility of antenatal couples' counselling in this study will inform the design of a fully randomised controlled clinical trial. If this trial demonstrates the feasibility of recruitment and delivery, we will seek funding to conduct a fully powered trial of the complex intervention for improving uptake of birth planning and postpartum family planning in Uganda.

However in many low and middle income countries, there is scarcity of information on magnitude of and risk factors for PPH (blood loss of 500 ml or more). It is important to understand the relative contributions of different risk factors for PPH. We assessed the incidence of, and risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage among rural women in Uganda. METHODS: Between March 2013 and March 2014, a prospective cohort study was conducted at six health facilities in Uganda. Women were administered a questionnaire to ascertain risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage, defined as a blood loss of 500 mls or more, and assessed using a calibrated under-buttocks drape at childbirth. We constructed two separate multivariable logistic regression models for the variables associated with PPH. Model 1 included all deliveries (vaginal and cesarean sections). Model 2 analysis was restricted to vaginal deliveries. In both models, we adjusted for clustering at facility level. RESULTS: Among the 1188 women, the overall incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was 9.0%, (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5-10.6%) and of severe postpartum hemorrhage (1000 mls or more) was 1.2%, (95% CI 0.6-2.0%). Most (1157 [97.4%]) women received a uterotonic after childbirth for postpartum hemorrhage prophylaxis. Risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage among all deliveries (model 1) were: cesarean section delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 7.54; 95% CI 4.11-13.81); multiple pregnancy (aOR 2.26; 95% CI 0.58-8.79); foetal macrosomia >/=4000 g (aOR 2.18; 95% CI 1.11-4.29); and HIV positive sero-status (aOR 1.93; 95% CI 1.06-3.50). Risk factors among vaginal deliveries only, were similar in direction and magnitude as in model 1, namely: multiple pregnancy, (aOR 7.66; 95% CI 1.81-32.34); macrosomia, (aOR 2.14; 95% CI1.02-4.47); and HIV positive sero-status (aOR 2.26; 95% CI 1.20-4.25). CONCLUSION: The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was high in our setting despite use of uterotonics. The risk factors identified could be addressed by extra vigilance during labour and preparedness for PPH management in all women giving birth.","2016-04","2024-02-20 10:59:24","2024-02-20 10:59:24","","38","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">lower level health facilities (5 health centre IIIs and one health centre IV) in Mpigi district, Central Uganda&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1188&nbsp;</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Uganda/epidemiology; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Logistic Models; Adolescent; Labor; Risk factors; *Rural Health; Severity of Illness Index; Cesarean Section/adverse effects; Fetal Macrosomia/physiopathology; HIV Seropositivity/physiopathology; Oxytocics; Oxytocics/therapeutic use; Postpartum hemorrhage; Postpartum Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/physiopathology; Pregnancy, Multiple","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report diarrhoea prevalence and all-cause mortality at 12 months of age according to infant feeding practices, among infants born to HIV-infected and uninfected mothers in South Africa. METHODS: A non-randomised intervention cohort study that followed both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected mothers and their infants until 18 months of age. Mothers were supported in their infant feeding choice. Detailed morbidity and vital status data were collected over the first year. At the time, only single dose nevirapine was available to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. RESULTS: Among 2,589 infants, detailed feeding data and vital status were available for 1,082 HIV-exposed infants and 1,155 HIV non-exposed infants. Among exclusively breastfed (EBF) infants there were 9.4 diarrhoeal days per 1,000 child days (95%CI. 9.12-9.82) while among infants who were never breastfed there were 15.6 diarrhoeal days per 1,000 child days (95%CI. 14.62-16.59). Exclusive breastfeeding was associated with fewer acute, persistent and total diarrhoeal events than mixed or no breastfeeding in both HIV-exposed infants and also infants of HIV uninfected mothers. In an adjusted cox regression analysis, the risk of death among all infants by 12 months of age was significantly greater in those who were never breastfed (aHR 3.5, p<0.001) or mixed fed (aHR 2.65, p<0.001) compared with those who were EBF. In separate multivariable analyses, infants who were EBF for shorter durations had an increased risk of death compared to those EBF for 5-6 months [aHR 2.18 (95% CI, 1.56-3.01); p<0.001]. DISCUSSION: In the context of antiretroviral drugs being scaled-up to eliminate new HIV infections among children, there is strong justification for financial and human resource investment to promote and support exclusive breastfeeding to improve HIV-free survival of HIV-exposed and non-exposed infants.","2013","2024-02-20 10:59:24","2024-02-20 10:59:24","","e81307","","12","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 12 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Niine antenatal clinics, 7 rural, 1 periurban and 1 in urban KwaZulu Natal, South Africa&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong></p> <p>2770</p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Cohort Studies; Young Adult; Male; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; South Africa/epidemiology; HIV Infections/*transmission; Mothers/*statistics & numerical data; Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data; Rural Population/statistics & numerical data; Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology; Diarrhea/*epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of women presenting in labor to 28 obstetric centres in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan between November 2001 and March 2003. Data were analysed using cross tabulations and multivariable logistic regression to determine if type of episiotomy by FGM classification had a significant impact on key maternal outcomes. Our main outcome measures were anal sphincter tears, intrapartum blood loss requiring an intervention, and postpartum haemorrhage. RESULTS: Type of episiotomy performed varied significantly by FGM status. Among women without FGM, the most common type of episiotomy performed was posterior lateral (25.4 %). The prevalence of the most extensive type of episiotomy, anterior and posterior lateral episiotomy increased with type of FGM. Among women without FGM, 0.4 % had this type of episiotomy. This increased to 0.6 % for women with FGM Types 1, 2 or 4 and to 54.6 % of all women delivering vaginally with FGM Type 3. After adjustment, women with an anterior episiotomy, (AOR = 0.15 95 %; CI 0.06-0.40); posterior lateral episiotomy (AOR = 0.68 95 %; CI 0.50-0.94) or both anterior and posterior lateral episiotomies performed concurrently (AOR = 0.21 95 % CI 0.12-0.36) were all significantly less likely to have anal sphincter tears compared to women without episiotomies. Women with anterior episiotomy (AOR = 0.08; 95%CI 0.02-0.24), posterior lateral episiotomy (AOR = 0.17 95 %; CI 0.05-0.52) and the combination of the two (AOR = 0.04 95 % CI 0.01-0.11) were significantly less likely to have postpartum haemorrhage compared with women who had no episiotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Among women living with FGM Type 3, episiotomies were protective against anal sphincter tears and postpartum haemorrhage. Further clinical and research is needed to guide clinical practice of when episiotomies should be performed.","2016-10","2024-02-20 10:59:24","2024-02-20 10:59:24","","131","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location name : </strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>: </strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>: </strong>&nbsp; <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">28 obstetric centers in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size : </strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">26,640&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Outcome/epidemiology; Socioeconomic Factors; *Obstetrics; Delivery, Obstetric/methods; Africa/epidemiology; *Circumcision; *Episiotomy; *Female genital mutilation; *FGM; Anal Canal/injuries; Cicatrix/etiology/surgery; Circumcision, Female/*adverse effects; Episiotomy/adverse effects/*methods; Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control; Obstetric Labor Complications/*epidemiology/prevention & control; Postpartum Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a retrospective survey study to assess the impact of nationwide strikes by health workers in 2017 on utilization of maternal and child health services in western Kenya. METHODS: We utilized a parent study to enroll women who were pregnant in 2017 when there were prolonged strikes by health workers (""strike group"") and women who were pregnant in 2018 when there were no major strikes (""control group""). Trained research assistants administered a close-ended survey to retrospectively collect demographic and pregnancy-related health utilization and outcomes data. Data were collected between March and July 2019. The primary outcomes of interest were antenatal care (ANC) visits, delivery location, and early child immunizations. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate risk ratios between the strike and control groups, adjusting for socioeconomic status, health insurance status, and clustering. Adjusted risk ratios (ARR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Of 1341 women recruited in the parent study in 2017 (strike group), we re-consented 843 women (63%) to participate. Of 924 women recruited in the control arm of the parent study in 2018 (control group), we re-consented 728 women (79%). Women in the strike group were 17% less likely to attend at least four ANC visits during their pregnancy (ARR 0.83, 95%CI 0.74, 0.94) and 16% less likely to deliver in a health facility (ARR 0.84, 95%CI 0.76, 0.92) compared to women in the control group. Whether a child received their first oral polio vaccine did not differ significantly between groups, but children of women in the strike group received their vaccine significantly longer after birth (13 days versus 7 days, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: We found that women who were pregnant during nationwide strikes by health workers in 2017 were less likely to receive WHO-recommended maternal child health services. Strategies to maintain these services during strikes are urgently needed.","2021-09","2024-02-20 10:59:24","2024-02-20 10:59:24","","898","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffd40080"">Trans Nzoia</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)"">Location Type :</span></strong></p> <p>Communities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)"">Description :</span></strong></p> <p>Trans Nzoia County is located in the western part of Kenya.</p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1341</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; *Maternal Health Services; Child; *Prenatal Care; Child Health; Kenya/epidemiology; Kenya; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Health worker strike; Maternal child health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a need for human data to inform policy makers and treatment guidelines on the safety of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) when used during early pregnancy. METHODS: The overall goal of this paper is to describe the methods and implementation of a study aimed at developing surveillance systems for identifying exposures to antimalarials during early pregnancy and for monitoring pregnancy outcomes using health and demographic surveillance platforms. This was a multi-center prospective observational cohort study involving women at health and demographic surveillance sites in three countries in Africa: Burkina Faso, Kenya and Mozambique [(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01232530)]. The study was designed to identify pregnant women with artemisinin exposure in the first trimester and compare them to: 1) pregnant women without malaria, 2) pregnant women treated for malaria, but exposed to other antimalarials, and 3) pregnant women with malaria and treated with artemisinins in the 2nd or 3rd trimesters from the same settings. Pregnant women were recruited through community-based surveys and attendance at health facilities, including antenatal care clinics and followed until delivery. Data from the three sites will be pooled for analysis at the end of the study. Results are forthcoming.

Of 1547 women admitted with preeclampsia 237 (15.3%) met AKI criteria: 6.9% (n=107) stage 1, 4.3% (n=67) stage 2, and 4.1% (n=63) stage 3. There was a higher risk of maternal death (n=7; relative risk, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.6-11.4) and stillbirth (n=80; relative risk, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8-2.8) in women with AKI compared with those without. Perinatal mortality was also increased (89 of 240; 37.1%). Hypertension in a previous pregnancy was the strongest predictor of AKI stage 2 or 3 (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.21-4.17). Renal recovery rate reduced with increasing AKI stage. A third of surviving women (76 of 230 [33.0%]) had not recovered baseline renal function by discharge. Approximately half (39 of 76; 51.3%) of these women had no further creatinine testing post-discharge. In summary, AKI was common in women with preeclampsia and had high rates of associated maternal and perinatal mortality. Only two-thirds of women had confirmed renal recovery. History of a previous hypertensive pregnancy was an important risk factor.","2019-11","2024-02-20 10:59:28","2024-02-20 10:59:28","","1144-1151","","5","74","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 5 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Groote Schuur Hospital , Tygerberg Hospital &nbsp;, Kimberley Hospital</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facility</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Tertiary hospital sites (Groote Schuur Hospital, Tygerberg Hospital, and Kimberley Hospital) in South Africa</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1547&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; *pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Poverty; South Africa; Follow-Up Studies; Adolescent; Developing Countries; Stillbirth/*epidemiology; Odds Ratio; *Perinatal Death; Survival Analysis; Pre-Eclampsia/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; Severity of Illness Index; *acute kidney injury; *creatinine; *preeclampsia; *renal insufficiency, chronic; Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy; Comorbidity; Confidence Intervals; Creatinine/blood; Kidney Function Tests; Maternal Death/*trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While disclosing IPV could open doors for support and eventually prevent partner abuse, the factors associated with IPV disclosure during pregnancy are not well known. The aim of this study was to examine factors influencing IPV disclosure to any person of interest or organization supporting women during pregnancy in Moshi Municipality, Tanzania. METHODS: Data were from a prospective cohort study of 1123 pregnant women followed-up by the project aiming to assess the impact of violence in the reproductive health conducted in Moshi Municipality, Tanzania from March 2014 to May 2015. Inclusion criteria to the current analysis were all 339 pregnant women who reported to have experienced physical, sexual and/or emotional violence during the index pregnancy. Data analysis used SPSS Version 20. Odds ratio with 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) for factors associated with IPV disclosure was estimated using multivariate logistic regression models while controlling for age, education and parity. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered for a statistically significant difference. RESULTS: IPV disclosure was found to be 23.3 % (n = 79). Disclosure of IPV was less likely among unemployed (OR = 0.5, 95 % CI 0.30-0.90) and women whose index pregnancy was unplanned (OR = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.29-0.98). Women who regularly participated in women's or community groups, religious groups or political associations at least once a month had 2 times higher odds of IPV disclosure compared to those who did not attend regularly (OR = 2.12, 95 % CI 1.13-3.95). Most of the abused women during pregnancy who disclosed their experience of IPV (69 %) disclosed to a member of the family of birth followed by friends (14 %) and a member of family of the partner (11 %). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the women who experienced IPV during pregnancy kept suffering in silence while less than a quarter of all the abused (23.3 %) disclosed their experience to someone. Identification of the women experiencing IPV during pregnancy should be done as a starting point for supporting victim of IPV. Women empowerment in economical and reproductive health will reduce their vulnerability and facilitate disclosure of IPV for support. Key individuals who informally support victims of IPV should be targeted in interventions.","2016-08","2024-02-20 10:59:28","2024-02-20 10:59:28","","715","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>: </strong><span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Majengo antenatal clinic , Pasua antenatal clinic</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Moshi Municipality district , Tanzania</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1123</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Pregnancy Complications; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Logistic Models; Adolescent; Tanzania; Sexual Partners; Odds Ratio; Social Support; *Pregnant Women; *Battered Women; *Disclosure; *Intimate Partner Violence; *IPV disclosure; *Partner violence during pregnancy; *Risk and protective factors; *Violence; Sexual Behavior; Spouse Abuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two of the probable outcomes are fetal anemia and cord blood malaria parasitemia. We determined clinical and demographic factors associated with fetal anemia and cord blood malaria parasitemia in newborns of HIV-positive women from two districts in Ghana. RESULTS: We enrolled 1,154 antenatal attendees (443 HIV-positive and 711 HIV-negative) of which 66% were prospectively followed up at delivery. Maternal malaria parasitemia, and anemia rates among HIV+ participants at enrolment were 20.3% and 78.7% respectively, and 12.8% and 51.6% among HIV- participants. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to study associations. Prevalence of fetal anemia (cord hemoglobin level < 12.5 g/dL) and cord parasitemia (presence of P. falciparum in cord blood at delivery) were 57.3% and 24.4% respectively. Factors found to be associated with fetal anemia were maternal malaria parasitemia and maternal anemia. Infant cord hemoglobin status at delivery was positively and significantly associated with maternal hemoglobin and gestational age whilst female gender of infant was negatively associated with cord hemoglobin status. Maternal malaria parasitemia status at recruitment and female gender of infant were positively associated with infant cord malaria parasitemia status. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that newborns of women infected with HIV and/or malaria are at increased risk of anemia and also cord blood malaria parasitemia. Prevention of malaria infection during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of both adverse perinatal outcomes.","2013-09","2024-02-20 10:59:28","2024-02-20 10:59:28","","350","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Tema </span></span><em><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">hospital</span></span></em><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> ,Atua </span></span><em><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">hospital</span></span></em><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> ,St Martin&nbsp;</span></span><em><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">de Porres hospital</span></span></em></p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facility</p> <p><strong>description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">3 hospitals in Ghana (Tema General Hospital in the Tema Municipality, Greater Accra region, Atua Government Hospital and St Martin&nbsp;</span></span><em><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">de Porres</span></span></em><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp;Hospital both in the Manya Krobo District, Eastern region.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1,154</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Male; Prevalence; Ghana/epidemiology; Infant; Pregnancy Outcome; Adolescent; Sex Factors; *Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Coinfection; Anemia/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Fetal Blood/parasitology; Fetal Hemoglobin/metabolism; HIV Infections/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology/transmission; Malaria, Falciparum/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology/transmission; Parasitemia/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology/transmission; Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Malaria diagnosis is often missed during pregnancy, because many women with placental malaria remain asymptomatic or have submicroscopic parasitemia, masking the association between malaria and pregnancy outcomes. Severe maternal anemia and low birthweight deliveries are well-established sequelae, but few studies have confirmed the relationship between malaria infection and severe outcomes like perinatal mortality in high transmission zones. METHODS: Pregnant women of any gestational age enrolled at antenatal clinic into a longitudinal cohort study in Ouelessebougou, Mali, an area of high seasonal malaria transmission. Follow-up visits included scheduled and unscheduled visits throughout pregnancy. Blood smear microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were employed to detect both microscopic and submicroscopic infections, respectively. Intermittent preventative treatment in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) was documented and prompt treatment regardless of symptoms given upon malaria diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 1850 women followed through delivery, 72.6% of women received 2 or more IPTp-SP doses, 67.2% of women experienced at least 1 infection between enrollment up to and including delivery. Malaria infection increased the risks of stillbirth (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-12.71) and preterm delivery (aHR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.35-4.29) in primigravidae, and early neonatal death (death within 7 days) in secundigravidae and multigravidae (aHR 6.30, 95% CI: 1.41-28.15). CONCLUSIONS: Malaria treatment after diagnosis, alongside IPTp-SP, is insufficient to prevent malaria-related stillbirth, early neonatal death and preterm delivery (PTD). Although IPTp-SP was beneficial in Mali during the study period, new tools are needed to improve pregnancy outcomes.

We aimed to determine the association of maternal Se concentrations during pregnancy with PTB risk and gestational duration in a large number of samples collected from diverse populations. METHODS: Gestational duration data and maternal plasma or serum samples of 9946 singleton live births were obtained from 17 geographically diverse study cohorts. Maternal Se concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis. The associations between maternal Se with PTB and gestational duration were analysed using logistic and linear regressions. The results were then combined using fixed-effect and random-effect meta-analysis. FINDINGS: In all study samples, the Se concentrations followed a normal distribution with a mean of 93.8 ng/mL (SD: 28.5 ng/mL) but varied substantially across different sites. The fixed-effect meta-analysis across the 17 cohorts showed that Se was significantly associated with PTB and gestational duration with effect size estimates of an OR=0.95 (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.00) for PTB and 0.66 days (95% CI: 0.38 to 0.94) longer gestation per 15 ng/mL increase in Se concentration. However, there was a substantial heterogeneity among study cohorts and the random-effect meta-analysis did not achieve statistical significance. The largest effect sizes were observed in UK (Liverpool) cohort, and most significant associations were observed in samples from Malawi. INTERPRETATION: While our study observed statistically significant associations between maternal Se concentration and PTB at some sites, this did not generalise across the entire cohort. Whether population-specific factors explain the heterogeneity of our findings warrants further investigation. Further evidence is needed to understand the biologic pathways, clinical efficacy and safety, before changes to antenatal nutritional recommendations for Se supplementation are considered.","2021-09","2024-02-20 10:59:27","2024-02-20 10:59:27","","","","9","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 9 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffd40080"">Soweto, Mangochi district Malawi, &nbsp;Pemba island Tanzania and Lusaka Zambia</span></p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>&nbsp;:</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;African countries only.</p> <p>Soweto, Johannesburg<strong> </strong>South Africa<strong> </strong>2 hospitals and 2 health centers in a rural area in Mangochi district Malawi, &nbsp;Pemba island Tanzania; Lusaka district Zambia</p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">9946</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Gestational Age; *Premature Birth/epidemiology; *epidemiology; *maternal health; *child health; *environmental health; *nutrition; *Selenium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, limited evidence was available on potential impacts of gestational diabetes mellitus using updated international diagnostic criteria on adverse maternal outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of gestational diabetes mellitus on the risk of adverse maternal outcomes in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among pregnant women followed from pregnancy to delivery. Gestational diabetes mellitus status was determined by using a two-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and based on updated international diagnostic criteria. Multivariable log-binomial model was used to examine the effects of gestational diabetes mellitus on the risk of adverse maternal outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 694 women completed the follow-up and included in the analysis. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus had a higher risk of composite adverse maternal outcome (ARR=1.58, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.04), caesarean delivery (ARR=1.67; 95%: 1.15, 2.44), pregnancy induced hypertension (ARR= 3.32; 95%: 1.55, 7.11), premature rupture of membranes (ARR= 1.83; 95%: 1.02, 3.27), antepartum hemorrhage (ARR= 2.10; 95%: 1.11, 3.98) and postpartum hemorrhage (ARR= 4.85; 95%:2.28, 10.30) compared to women without gestational diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational diabetes mellitus increased the risk of adverse maternal outcomes. This implies that maternal care and intervention strategies relating to women with gestational diabetes mellitus should be strengthened.","2020-02","2024-02-20 10:59:27","2024-02-20 10:59:27","","73","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>(UoGCSH) Health Center , Gondar Health Center, Woleka Health Center, Maraki Health Center, Azezo Health Center</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities, (UoGCSH) and Gondar, Woleka, Maraki, Azezo Health Centers) , Gondar town is located in Northwest Ethiopia</p> <p><strong>Sample Size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">694&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; adverse maternal outcome; antepartum hemorrhage; Gestational diabetes mellitus; postpartum hemorrhage; pregnancy induced hypertension; premature rupture of membranes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Newborn weights measured within days after birth and knowledge of the growth patterns in the first week of life can help estimate the weight at birth retrospectively. This study aimed to generate sex-specific prediction maps and weight reference charts for the retrospective estimation of birthweight for exclusively breastfed newborns in a low-resource setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study nested in a clinical trial of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy for malaria with either dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with/without azithromycin or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Korogwe District, north-eastern Tanzania (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03208179). Newborns were weighed at birth or in the immediate hours after birth and then daily for 1 week. Reference charts, nadir, time to regain weight, and prediction maps were generated using nonlinear mixed-effects models fitted to the longitudinal data, incorporating interindividual variation as random effects. Predictions and prediction standard deviations were computed using a linear approximation approach. RESULTS: Between March and December 2019, 513 live newborns with birthweights measured within 24 h of delivery were weighed daily for 1 week. Complete datasets were available from 476 exclusively breastfed newborns. There was a rapid decline in weight shortly after delivery. The average weight loss, time of nadir, and time to regain weight were 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.8-4.9) at 27 h (95% CI 24-30) and 105 h (95% CI 91-120) in boys and 4.9% (95% CI 4.2-5.6) at 28 h (95% CI 23-33) and 114 h (95% CI 93-136) in girls, respectively. The data were used to generate prediction maps with 1-h time intervals and 0.05 kg weight increments showing the predicted birthweights and weight-for-age and weight-change-for-age reference charts depicting variation in weight loss from <1 to >10%. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction maps and reference charts can be used by researchers in low-resource settings to retrospectively estimate birthweights using weights collected up to 168 h after delivery, thereby maximizing data utilization. Clinical practitioners can also use the prediction maps to retrospectively classify newborns as low birthweight or small for gestational age.","2022-03","2024-02-20 10:59:27","2024-02-20 10:59:27","","293-302","","3","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 3 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities in Korogwe district</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>: </strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Korogwe District, north-eastern Tanzania</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample siz</strong>e<strong> :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">617&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Male; *Breast Feeding; weight; Newborn; infants; *Fetal Growth Retardation; exclusive breastfeeding; growth; weight loss; Weight Loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global health","","2214-109X (LINKING)","10.1016/S2214-109X(16)30215-7","","BACKGROUND: Chlorhexidine umbilical cord washes reduce neonatal mortality in south Asian populations with high neonatal mortality rates and predominantly home-based deliveries. No data exist for sub-Saharan African populations with lower neonatal mortality rates or mostly facility-based deliveries. We compared the effect of chlorhexidine with dry cord care on neonatal mortality rates in Zambia. METHODS: We undertook a cluster-randomised controlled trial in Southern Province, Zambia, with 90 health facility-based clusters. We enrolled women who were in their second or third trimester of pregnancy, aged at least 15 years, and who would remain in the catchment area for follow-up of 28 days post-partum. Newborn babies received clean dry cord care (control) or topical application of 10 mL of a 4% chlorhexidine solution once per day until 3 days after cord drop (intervention), according to cluster assignment. We used stratified, restricted randomisation to divide clusters into urban or two rural groups (located <40 km or >/=40 km to referral facility), and randomly assigned clusters (1:1) to use intervention (n=45) or control treatment (n=45). Sites, participants, and field monitors were aware of their study assignment. The primary outcomes were all-cause neonatal mortality within 28 days post-partum and all-cause neonatal mortality within 28 days post-partum among babies who survived the first 24 h of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. Neonatal mortality rate was compared with generalised estimating equations. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01241318). FINDINGS: From Feb 15, 2011, to Jan 30, 2013, we screened 42 356 pregnant women and enrolled 39 679 women (mean 436.2 per cluster [SD 65.3]), who had 37 856 livebirths and 723 stillbirths; 63.8% of deliveries were facility-based. Of livebirths, 18 450 (99.7%) newborn babies in the chlorhexidine group and 19 308 (99.8%) newborn babies in the dry cord care group were followed up to day 28 or death. 16 660 (90.0%) infants in the chlorhexidine group had chlorhexidine applied within 24 h of birth. We found no significant difference in neonatal mortality rate between the chlorhexidine group (15.2 deaths per 1000 livebirths) and the dry cord care group (13.6 deaths per 1000 livebirths; risk ratio [RR] 1.12, 95% CI 0.88-1.44). Eliminating day 0 deaths yielded similar findings (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86-1.47). INTERPRETATION: Despite substantial reductions previously reported in south Asia, chlorhexidine cord applications did not significantly reduce neonatal mortality rates in Zambia. Chlorhexidine cord applications do not seem to provide clear benefits for newborn babies in settings with predominantly facility-based deliveries and lower (<30 deaths per 1000 livebirths) neonatal mortality rates.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 1,000 women in Accra, Ghana (2012-2014), was conducted. Women were classified as having overweight (BMI 25-30) and obesity (BMI >/= 30), and their obstetric and infant outcomes were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The analysis included 824 women, average 28 years (SD 5.1); 313 (31.3%) had overweight and 169 (16.9%) obesity. Women with obesity had a two-fold increased risk for cesarean sections (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.21-4.02) and more than a six-fold higher risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension (RR 6.17, 95% CI 2.90-13.13) and chronic hypertension (RR 6.00, 95% CI 1.40-25.76). Infants of women with overweight or obesity were more likely to be macrosomic (RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.13-4.97). CONCLUSIONS: The global obesity epidemic has reached women in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) with important adverse consequences for maternal and infant health. Antenatal care in LMIC will need to anticipate this potential expansion of complications, including the development of guidelines for optimal maternity care for pregnant women with overweight and obesity.","2016-01","2024-02-20 10:59:27","2024-02-20 10:59:27","","215-22","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Two public hospitals in Accra, capital city of Ghana</p> <p><strong>sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>1010</p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Ghana; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Outcome/*epidemiology; *Developing Countries; Gestational Age; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced/epidemiology; Infant; Pregnancy Complications/*epidemiology; *Body Mass Index; Obesity/*epidemiology; Fetal Macrosomia/epidemiology; Cesarean Section/adverse effects; Overweight/*epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data on the outcomes of HIV-exposed infants (HEI) compared to their unexposed counterparts in the era of universal ART is limited. We compared birth and 6-week outcomes among infants born to HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in Lesotho. METHODS: 941 HIV-negative and 653 HIV-positive pregnant women were enrolled in an observational cohort to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) program after implementation of universal maternal ART in 14 health facilities. Pregnancy, delivery, birth, and 6-week data were collected through participant interviews and medical record review. DNA PCR testing for HEI was conducted within 2 weeks of birth and at around 6 weeks of age. Data were analysed to estimate the distribution of birth outcomes, mortality, HIV transmission and HIV-free survival at 6 weeks. RESULTS: HIV-positive women were older (mean age of 28.7 vs. 24.4 years) and presented for antenatal care earlier (mean gestational age of 23.0 weeks vs 25.3 weeks) than HIV-negative women. Prematurity was more frequent among HEI, 7.8% vs. 3.6%. There was no difference in rates of congenital anomalies between HEI (1.0%) and HIV-unexposed infants (HUI) (0.6%). Cumulative HIV transmission was 0.9% (N = 4/431) (95% CI:0.25-2.36) at birth and 1.0% (N = 6/583) (95% CI:0.38-2.23) at 6 weeks. Overall mortality, including stillbirths, was 5.2% and 6.0% by 6 weeks for HUI and HEI respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of universal maternal ART lowers MTCT at 6 weeks of age with no differences in congenital anomalies or early mortality between HIV exposed Infants and HIV unexposed infants. However, HIV exposed infants continue to have high rates of prematurity despite improved maternal health on ART.","2019","2024-02-20 10:59:27","2024-02-20 10:59:27","","e0226339","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 12 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">14 health facilities from 3 districts in Lesotho–Botha-Bothe, Thaba-Tseka and Mohale’s Hoek</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>1594</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Infant; Infant Mortality; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*drug therapy; Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use; Case-Control Studies; Premature Birth/epidemiology; numerical data; Maternal Age; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control/statistics &; Lesotho; HIV Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*transmission; HIV/genetics; RNA, Viral/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In rural Tanzania, women face significant barriers accessing health care facilities for their deliveries. METHODS: From January 2017 to February 2019 we conducted a multiple baseline (interrupted time series) trial within the four divisions of Rorya District, Tanzania. We collected baseline data, then sequentially introduced a complex intervention in each of the divisions, in randomized order, over 3 month intervals. We allowed for a 6 month transition period to avoid contamination between the pre- and post-intervention periods. The intervention included using community health workers to educate about safe delivery, distribution of birth kits with misoprostol, and a transport subsidy for women living a distance from the health care facility. The primary outcome was the health facility birth rate, while the secondary outcomes were the rates of antenatal and postpartum care and postpartum hemorrhage. Outcomes were analyzed using fixed effects segmented logistic regression, adjusting for age, marital status, education, and parity. Maternal and baby morbidity/mortality were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 9565 pregnant women (2634 before and 6913 after the intervention was implemented). Facility births increased from 1892 (71.8%) before to 5895 (85.1%) after implementation of the intervention. After accounting for the secular trend, the intervention was associated with an immediate increase in the odds of facility births (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.01, p = 0.0045) as well as a small gradual effect (OR = 1.03 per month, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.07, p = 0.0633). For the secondary outcomes, there were no statistically significant immediate changes associated with the intervention. Rates of maternal and baby morbidity/mortality were low and similar between the pre- and post-implementation periods. CONCLUSIONS: Access to health care facilities can be improved through implementation of education of the population by community health workers about the importance of a health care facility birth, provision of birth kits with misoprostol to women in late pregnancy, and access to a transport subsidy for delivery for women living at a distance from the health facility.

METHODS: This was an analysis of secondary outcomes from a multi-centre randomized controlled equivalence trial at district level in Uganda. Women with first trimester incomplete abortion were randomly allocated to clinical assessment and treatment with misoprostol by a physician or a midwife. The randomisation (1:1) was done in blocks of 12 and stratified for health care facility. Acceptability was measured in expectations and satisfaction at a follow up visit 14-28 days following treatment. Analysis of women's overall acceptability was done using a generalized linear mixed-effects model with an equivalence range of -4% to 4%. The study was not masked. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.org, NCT 01844024. RESULTS: From April 2013 to June 2014, 1108 women were assessed for eligibility of which 1010 were randomized (506 to midwife and 504 to physician). 953 women were successfully followed up and included in the acceptability analysis. 95% (904) of the participants found the treatment satisfactory and overall acceptability was found to be equivalent between the two study groups. Treatment failure, not feeling calm and safe following treatment, experiencing severe abdominal pain or heavy bleeding following treatment, were significantly associated with non-satisfaction.

Identification and support for HIV negative pregnant women and their partners, particularly serodiscordant couples, are critical. A mixed method study done in Southern Mozambique estimated HIV incidence during pregnancy, associated risk factors and factors influencing partner's HIV testing. METHODS: Between April 2008 and November 2011, a prospective cohort of 1230 HIV negative pregnant women was followed during pregnancy. A structured questionnaire, HIV testing, and collection of dried blood spots were done at 2-3 scheduled visits. HIV incidence rates were calculated by repeat HIV testing and risk factors assessed by Poisson regression. A qualitative study including 37 individual interviews with men, women, and nurses and 11 focus group discussions (n = 94) with men, women and grandmothers explored motivators and barriers to uptake of male HIV testing. RESULTS: HIV incidence rate was estimated at 4.28/100 women-years (95%CI: 2.33-7.16). Significant risk factors for HIV acquisition were early sexual debut (RR 3.79, 95%CI: 1.04-13.78, p = 0.04) and living in Maputo Province (RR 4.35, 95%CI: 0.97-19.45, p = 0.05). Nineteen percent of women reported that their partner had tested for HIV (93% knew the result with 8/213 indicating an HIV positive partner), 56% said their partner had not tested and 19% did not know their partner test status. Of the 14 seroconversions, only one reported being in a serodiscordant relationship. Fear of discrimination or stigma was reported as a key barrier to male HIV testing, while knowing the importance of getting tested and receiving care was the main motivator. CONCLUSIONS: HIV incidence during pregnancy is high in Southern Mozambique, but knowledge of partners' HIV status remains low. Knowledge of both partners' HIV status is critical for maximal effectiveness of prevention and treatment services to reach elimination of pediatric HIV/AIDS.","2014","2024-02-20 10:59:26","2024-02-20 10:59:26","","e115014","","12","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 12 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Chibuto </span></span>Health facility<span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">, Chicumbane </span></span>Health facility<span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> ,Malehice </span></span>Health facility<span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">,Marracuene </span></span>Health facility<span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">, Moamba </span></span>Health facility<span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> , Boane </span></span>Health facility</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Six rural health facilities and their surrounding communities in Gaza (Chibuto, Chicumbane and Malehice) and Maputo (Marracuene, Moamba and Boane) provinces in Southern Mozambiqu</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1230</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Male; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Mozambique/epidemiology; Interviews as Topic; Early Diagnosis; HIV Seropositivity/*diagnosis/*epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS/DESIGN: The Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS) is a cluster-randomized trial that evaluates the efficacy of clean fuels (liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG) and efficient biomass cookstoves in the Brong-Ahafo region of central Ghana. We recruit pregnant women into LPG, efficient cookstove, and control arms and track birth weight and physician-assessed severe pneumonia incidence in the first year of life. A woman is eligible to participate if she is in the first or second trimester of pregnancy and carrying a live singleton fetus, if she is the primary cook, and if she does not smoke. We hypothesize that babies born to intervention mothers will weigh more and will have fewer cases of physician-assessed severe pneumonia in the first year of life. Additionally, an extensive personal air pollution exposure monitoring effort opens the way for exposure-response analyses, which we will present alongside intention-to-treat analyses. Major funding was provided by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, The Thrasher Research Fund, and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. DISCUSSION: Household air pollution exposure is a major health risk that requires well-tested interventions. GRAPHS will provide important new evidence on the efficacy of both efficient biomass cookstoves and LPG, and will thus help inform health and energy policies in developing countries.

METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted on 1 300 women attending the antenatal service at Saint Camille Medical Centre from September 2010 to July 2011. The HIV status of mothers was determined by rapid tests and ELISA. Discordant results were confirmed by real-time PCR. PCR was used to determine HIV status of children born from HIV-positive mothers. RESULTS: Among 1 300 pregnant women tested for HIV, 378 were seropositive. Mothers were predominantly housewives (69.7%), and their mean age was (28.32+/-0.15) years. The overall prevalence of HIV transmission from mother to child was 4.8% (18/378). This prevalence differed significantly from 0.0% (0/114) to 6.8% (18/264) in children born from mothers under HAART and those with mothers under New Prophylactic Protocol (AZT + 3TC + NVP), respectively (P< 0.01). Children's mortality rate during the medical follow up was 1.3% (5/378). Among 16 women with HIV dubious status by ELISA, the Real Time PCR confirmed 2/16 (12.5%) as HIV positive. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol of prevention of mother to children HIV transmission (PMTCT) is effective. The rate of HIV vertical transmission is significantly reduced. Early diagnosis determined by PCR of children born from HIV-positive mother is necessary and recommended in the context of PMTCT in Burkina Faso. We also found that PCR is an effective tool to confirm HIV status in pregnant women.","2012-12","2024-02-20 10:59:25","2024-02-20 10:59:25","","991-4","","12","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 12 Place: India","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Saint Camille Medical Centre , Biomolecular Research Centre Pietro Annigoni / Ouagadougou</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Saint Camille Medical Centre &amp; &nbsp;Biomolecular Research Centre Pietro Annigoni, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.</p> <p><strong>Sample size &nbsp;: &nbsp;</strong><span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)"">1 300&nbsp;</span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Prevalence; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; Socioeconomic Factors; Child; Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Burkina Faso/epidemiology; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active/*methods; HIV Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report outcomes at 3 years follow-up. METHODS: The CORONIS trial was a pragmatic international 2 x 2 x 2 x 2x 2 non-regular fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial done at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan. Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision. Women were randomly assigned by a secure web-based allocation system to one intervention from each of the three assigned pairs. All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation. In this follow-up study, we compared outcomes at 3 years following blunt versus sharp abdominal entry, exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair, single versus double layer closure of the uterus, closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum, and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 for uterine repair. Outcomes included pelvic pain; deep dyspareunia; hysterectomy and outcomes of subsequent pregnancies. Outcomes were assessed masked to the original trial allocation. This trial is registered with the Current Controlled Trials registry, number ISRCTN31089967. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2011, and Sept 30, 2014, 13,153 (84%) women were followed-up for a mean duration of 3.8 years (SD 0.86). For blunt versus sharp abdominal entry there was no evidence of a difference in risk of abdominal hernias (adjusted RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.39-1.11). We also recorded no evidence of a difference in risk of death or serious morbidity of the children born at the time of trial entry (0.99, 0.83-1.17). For exteriorisation of the uterus versus intra-abdominal repair there was no evidence of a difference in risk of infertility (0.91, 0.71-1.18) or of ectopic pregnancy (0.50, 0.15-1.66). For single versus double layer closure of the uterus there was no evidence of a difference in maternal death (0.78, 0.46-1.32) or a composite of pregnancy complications (1.20, 0.75-1.90). For closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum there was no evidence of a difference in any outcomes relating to symptoms associated with pelvic adhesions such as infertility (0.80, 0.61-1.06). For chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 sutures there was no evidence of a difference in the main comparisons for adverse pregnancy outcomes in a subsequent pregnancy, such as uterine rupture (3.05, 0.32-29.29). Overall, severe adverse outcomes were uncommon in these settings. INTERPRETATION: Although our study was not powered to detect modest differences in rare but serious events, there was no evidence to favour one technique over another. Other considerations will probably affect clinical practice, such as the time and cost saving of different approaches.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic capacity of hematologic biomarkers to detect IDA among pregnant women in Tanzania. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We pooled data from an iron supplementation trial of 1500 iron-replete pregnant woman and a prospective cohort of 600 iron-deficient pregnant women. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) for hematologic biomarkers were used to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA), crude, or corrected for inflammation. Regression models assessed the relationship of baseline biomarker categories (gestational age <27 weeks) and IDA at delivery. RESULTS: Hemoglobin had the largest AUC for crude ID (0.96), while hepcidin had the largest AUC for corrected ID (0.80). The optimal hepcidin cutoff for the diagnosis of corrected IDA based on maximal sensitivity and specificity was </=1.6 microg/L. An hepcidin cutoff of <4.3 microg/L had a sensitivity of 95% for regression-corrected ID. Among iron-replete women who did not receive iron, the association of baseline hemoglobin >110 g/L with IDA at delivery (RR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.13) was attenuated. Baseline hepcidin >1.6 microg/L was associated with reduced risk of anemia at delivery by 49% (95% CI: 27%, 45%). CONCLUSIONS: Ascertaining hemoglobin and hepcidin levels may improve the targeting of iron supplementation programs in resource-limited countries, though hepcidin's high costs may limit its use.","2020-05","2024-02-20 10:59:35","2024-02-20 10:59:35","","708-719","","5","74","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 5 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>Antenatal clinics in Dar es-Salaam, Tanzania</p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>2,100</p> </div>","C:\Users\leon.mbano\Zotero\storage\AGVXZVNP\Abioye AI et al. - 2020 - Hemoglobin and hepcidin have good validity and uti.pdf","","eppi-reviewer4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed whether combining the provision of supplies with a behavioural intervention was more effective than providing supplies only, to improve syphilis screening and treatment during antenatal care. METHODS: In this 18-month, cluster randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned (1:1) 26 urban antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Lusaka, Zambia, to receive a behavioural intervention (opinion leader selection, academic detailing visits, reminders, audits and feedback, and supportive supervision) plus supplies for syphilis testing and treatment (intervention group) or to receive supplies only (control group). The primary outcomes were proportion of pregnant women who had syphilis screening out of the total who attended the clinic; and the proportion of women who had treatment with benzathine benzylpenicillin out of those who tested positive for syphilis at their first antenatal care visit. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02353117. FINDINGS: The 18-month study period was Feb 1, 2016, to July 14, 2017. 18 357 women were enrolled at the 13 intervention clinics and 17 679 women were enrolled at the 13 control clinics at their first antenatal care visit. Syphilis screening was done in a median of 99.9% (IQR 99.0-100.0) of women in the intervention clinics and 93.8% (85.0-98.9) in the control clinics (absolute difference 6.1% [95% CI 1.1-14.1]; p=0.00092). Syphilis treatment at the first visit was done in a median of 100% (IQR 99.7-100.0) of seropositive women in intervention clinics and 43.2% (2.6-83.2) of seropositive women in control clinics (absolute difference 56.8% [12.8-99.0]; p=0.0028). INTERPRETATION: A behavioural intervention, together with the provision of supplies, can lead to more than 95% of women being screened and treated for syphilis. The sole provision of supplies is sufficient to reach such levels of screening coverage but is not sufficient to ensure high levels of treatment.

We sought to assess the rates of ACS use at all levels of health care in low and middle income countries (LMIC). METHODS: We assessed rates of ACS in 7 sites in 6 LMIC participating in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Global Network for Women and Children's Health Research Antenatal Corticosteroids Trial (ACT), a cluster-randomized trial to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of a multifaceted intervention designed to increase the use of ACS. We conducted this analysis using data from the control clusters, which did not receive any components of the intervention and intended to follow usual care. We included women who delivered an infant with a birth weight <5th percentile, a proxy for preterm birth, and were enrolled in the Maternal Newborn Health (MNH) Registry between October 2011 and March 2014 in all clusters. A survey of the site investigators regarding existing policies on ACS in health facilities and for health workers in the community was part of pre-trial activities. RESULTS: Overall, of 51,523 women delivered in control clusters across all sites, the percentage of <5th percentile babies ranged from 3.5 % in Kenya to 10.7 % in Pakistan. There was variation among the sites in the use of ACS at all hospitals and among those hospitals having cesarean section and neonatal care capabilities (bag and mask and oxygen or mechanical ventilation). Rates of ACS use for <5th percentile babies in all hospitals ranged from 3.8 % in the Kenya sites to 44.5 % in the Argentina site, and in hospitals with cesarean section and neonatal care capabilities from 0 % in Zambia to 43.5 % in Argentina. ACS were rarely used in clinic or home deliveries at any site. Guidelines for ACS use at all levels of the health system were available for most of the sites. CONCLUSION: Our study reports an overall low utilization of ACS among mothers of <5th percentile infants in hospital and clinic deliveries in LMIC.

However, the potential impact of antenatal depression on use of institutional delivery and postnatal care has seldom been examined. This study aimed to examine whether antenatal depressive symptoms are associated with use of maternal health care services. METHODS: A population-based prospective study was conducted in Sodo District, Southern Ethiopia. Depressive symptoms were assessed during pregnancy with a locally validated, Amharic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). A cut off score of five or more indicated possible depression. A total of 1251 women were interviewed at a median of 8 weeks (4-12 weeks) after delivery. Postnatal outcome variables were: institutional delivery care utilization, type of delivery, i.e. spontaneous or assisted, and postnatal care utilization. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between antenatal depressive symptoms and the outcome variables. RESULTS: High levels of antenatal depressive symptoms (PHQ score 5 or higher) were found in 28.7% of participating women. Nearly two-thirds, 783 women (62.6%), delivered in healthcare institutions. After adjusting for potential confounders, women with antenatal depressive symptoms had increased odds of reporting institutional birth [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) =1.42, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.06, 1.92] and increased odds of reporting having had an assisted delivery (aOR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.69) as compared to women without these symptoms. However, the increased odds of institutional delivery among women with antenatal depressive symptoms was associated with unplanned delivery care use mainly due to emergency reasons (aOR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.42) rather than planning to deliver in healthcare institutions. CONCLUSION: Improved detection and treatment of antenatal depression has the potential to increase planned institutional delivery and reduce perinatal complications, thus contributing to a reduction in maternal morbidity and mortality.","2017-06","2024-02-20 10:59:35","2024-02-20 10:59:35","","206","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: #ffd40080"">Sodo District, Southern Ethiopia</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Communities</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Sodo District, located in Southern Ethiopia.</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: var(--tw-prose-bold)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Sample size :</span></span></strong><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1251</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""><br></span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Ethiopia; Health Facilities/*statistics & numerical data; Delivery, Obstetric/*statistics & numerical data; Obstetric Labor Complications/*epidemiology; Parity; Prenatal Care/statistics & numerical data; Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data; Antenatal depressive symptoms; Assisted delivery; Delivery care use; Depression/*epidemiology; Developing Countries/*statistics & numerical data; Educational Measurement; Planned institutional delivery; Postnatal care use; Postnatal Care/statistics & numerical data; Rural Population/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: HIV-1-infected pregnant women from 5 sites in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and South Africa were enrolled in the study that comprised 2 prospective cohorts and 1 randomized controlled trial. Women were counseled to either breastfeed exclusively up to 6 months or formula feed from birth. METHODS: Determinants of breastfeeding initiation and continuation by 3 months postpartum were investigated using multiple logistic regression analysis. Neonatal morbidity was defined as mother-reported fever, diarrhea, or vomiting during the first month of life. RESULTS: Among 1028, 781 women (76%) initiated breastfeeding and 565 of 995 (56%) were still breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum (30% exclusively, 18% predominantly, and 8% partially). Study site (Durban, Mombasa, and Nairobi compared with Bobo-Dioulasso), CD4 cell count (<200 cells/mm), secondary schooling (compared with none), and emergency cesarean delivery (compared with vaginal delivery) were independently associated with a lower probability of ever breastfeeding. The odds of still breastfeeding by 3 months postpartum (among those breastfeeding by 1 month) were lower in Mombasa, Nairobi, and Somkhele (compared with Bobo-Dioulasso) and among infants with neonatal morbidity [0.60 (0.37-0.976)]. The odds of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) by 3 months (if EBF by 1 month) were lower in Mombasa and Nairobi, in ill neonates [0.54 (0.31-0.93)] and boys [0.51 (0.34-0.77)]. CONCLUSIONS: EBF was of short duration, particularly for boys. The importance of neonatal morbidity for breastfeeding cessation requires further investigation. Infant feeding counseling might need adaptation to better support mothers of boys and ill neonates.","2013-01","2024-02-20 10:59:35","2024-02-20 10:59:35","","109-18","","1","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Centre de Sante d'Ahouansori Agué , Hôpital Bethesda in Cotonou, Siaya District Hospital , Zomba Central Hospital , Teule Hospital , National Institute for Medical Research/Nyamagana District Hospital , Mulanda Health Centre IV </span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Health facilities and Communities</p> <p><strong>Description : </strong><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">5 sites</span></span></p> <ol> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso (West Africa)</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Nairobi and Mombasa, Kenya (East Africa)</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Durban and a rural and semiurban area of</span></span> </li> <li> <span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">KwaZulu-Natal (Somkhele), Republic of South Africa.</span></span> </li> </ol> <p><strong>sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1028</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Male; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; South Africa/epidemiology; Kenya/epidemiology; HIV-1/*isolation & purification; Burkina Faso/epidemiology; Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data; HIV Infections/*epidemiology/*transmission; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Per cent attributable risk estimates were generated for maternal, fetal and neonatal mortality. RESULTS: Screening echocardiography was performed in 3506 women. The prevalence of heart disease was 17 per 1000 women (95% CI 13 to 21); 15 per 1000 was rheumatic heart disease. Only 3.4% of women (2/58) had prior diagnosis. Cardiovascular complications occurred in 51% of women with heart disease, most commonly heart failure. Per cent attributable risk of heart disease on maternal mortality was 88.6% in the exposed population and 10.8% in the overall population. Population attributable risk of heart disease on fetal death was 1.1% and 6.0% for neonatal mortality CONCLUSIONS: Occult maternal heart disease may be responsible for a substantial proportion of adverse pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings. Rheumatic heart disease is, by far, the most common condition, urging global prioritisation of this neglected cardiovascular disease.","2019-05","2024-02-20 10:59:35","2024-02-20 10:59:35","","755-760","","10","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 10 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>Three Ugandan health centers</p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>3506</p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; *pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Uganda/epidemiology; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Outcome/*epidemiology; Infant; Follow-Up Studies; Adolescent; Infant Mortality; Time Factors; *global health; *valvular heart disease; Heart Diseases/*epidemiology; Maternal Mortality/trends; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/*epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: We explored the impact of training birth attendants and pregnant women in the Essential Newborn Care (ENC) Program on fresh stillbirths (FSBs) and early (7-day) neonatal deaths (END) by maternal education level in developing countries. METHODS: A train-the-trainer model was used with local instructors in rural communities in six countries (Argentina, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, India, Pakistan, and Zambia). Data were collected using a pre-/post-active baseline controlled study design. RESULTS: A total of 57,643 infants/mothers were enrolled. The follow-up rate at 7 days of age was 99.2%. The risk for FSB and END was higher for mothers with 0-7 years of education than for those with >/=8 years of education during both the pre- and post-ENC periods in unadjusted models and in models adjusted for confounding. The effect of ENC differed as a function of maternal education for FSB (interaction p = 0.041) without evidence that the effect of ENC differed as a function of maternal education for END. The model-based estimate of FSB risk was reduced among mothers with 0-7 years of education (19.7/1,000 live births pre-ENC, CI: 16.3, 23.0 vs. 12.2/1,000 live births post-ENC, CI: 16.3, 23.0, p < 0.001), but was not significantly different for mothers with >/=8 years of education, respectively. CONCLUSION: A low level of maternal education was associated with higher risk for FSB and END. ENC training was more effective in reducing FSB among mothers with low education levels.","2017","2024-02-20 10:59:35","2024-02-20 10:59:35","","61-67","","1","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: Switzerland","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name </strong></p> <p>Names not specified </p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Communities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Rural communities in six countries (Argentina, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, India, Pakistan, and Zambia)</span></span></p> <p><strong>sample size :</strong></p> <p>14567</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Male; Risk Assessment; Logistic Models; Infant; Developing Countries; Stillbirth/*epidemiology; Asia; *Infant Mortality; Africa; Multivariate Analysis; *Educational Status; Intensive Care, Neonatal/*standards; Latin America","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such occult infections are common during pregnancy but their impact on pregnancy outcomes is unclear. We performed a longitudinal study to describe that impact. METHODS: In a cohort of 1037 Beninese pregnant women, we used ultrasound to accurately estimate gestational ages. Infection with P. falciparum, hemoglobin concentration, use of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) for malaria, and other parameters were recorded during pregnancy. Using multivariate analyses, we evaluated the impact of submicroscopic infections on maternal anemia, premature birth, and low birth weight. RESULTS: At inclusion, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microscopy detected infection in 40% and 16% of women, respectively. The proportion infected declined markedly after 2 doses of IPTp but rebounded to 34% (by PCR) at delivery. Submicroscopic infections during pregnancy were associated with lower mean hemoglobin irrespective of gravidity, and with increased anemia risk in primigravidae (odds ratio [OR], 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], .98-5.07). Prospectively, submicroscopic infections at inclusion were associated with significantly increased risks of low birth weight in primigravidae (OR, 6.09; 95% CI, 1.16-31.95) and premature births in multigravidae (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.13-4.46). CONCLUSIONS: In this detailed longitudinal study, we document the deleterious impact of submicroscopic P. falciparum parasitemia during pregnancy on multiple pregnancy outcomes. Parasitemia occurs frequently during pregnancy, but routine microscopic and rapid diagnostic tests fail to detect the vast majority of episodes. Our findings imply caution in any revision of the current strategies for prevention of pregnancy-associated malaria.","2015-05","2024-02-20 10:59:35","2024-02-20 10:59:35","","1481-8","","10","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 10 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Comé</span></span><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Comé central, Ouedeme-Pedah, Akodeha</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>: </strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description : </strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">conducted in Comé district, a semirural area of southern Benin, 70 km west of Cotonou, the commercial capital of Benin</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(239, 242, 247)"">1037</span></span></strong></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Premature Birth; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Longitudinal Studies; *Infant, Low Birth Weight; Adolescent; Benin/epidemiology; malaria; pregnancy; Microscopy; Plasmodium falciparum; Polymerase Chain Reaction; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Anemia/epidemiology/*etiology; Diagnostic Tests, Routine/*methods; Malaria, Falciparum/*complications/epidemiology; PCR; submicroscopic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effectiveness of community support programmes for HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants in SSA is unclear. This study compared initiation of maternal antiretrovirals and infant outcomes amongst HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants who received and did not receive community-based support (CBS) in a high HIV-prevalence setting in South Africa. A cohort study, including HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants, was conducted at three sentinel surveillance facilities between January 2009 and June 2012, utilising enhanced routine clinical data. Through home visits, CBS workers encouraged uptake of interventions in the ART cascade, provided HIV-related education, ART initiation counselling and psychosocial support. Outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox and log-binomial regression. Amongst 1105 mother-infant pairs included, 264 (23.9%) received CBS. Amongst women eligible to start ART antenatally, women who received CBS had a reduced risk of not initiating antenatal ART, 5.4% vs. 30.3%; adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 0.18 (95% CI: 0.08-0.44; P < .0001). Women who received CBS initiated antenatal ART with less delay after the first antenatal visit, median 26 days vs. 39 days; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.57 (95% CI: 1.15-2.14; P = .004). Amongst women who initiated antenatal zidovudine (ZDV) to prevent vertical transmission, women who received CBS initiated ZDV with less delay, aHR = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.18-2.01; P = .001). Women who received CBS had a lower risk of stillbirth, 1.5% vs. 5.4%; aRR = 0.24 (95% CI: 0.07-1.00; P = .050). Pregnant women living with HIV who received CBS had improved antenatal triple ART initiation in eligible women, women initiated ART and ZDV with shorter delays, and had a lower risk of stillbirth. CBS is an intervention that shows promise in improving maternal and infant health in high HIV-prevalence settings.","2016","2024-02-20 10:59:34","2024-02-20 10:59:34","","114-8","","","28 Suppl 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">The study was conducted at three urban public facilities in the Nelson Mandela Bay district of South Africa,</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)"">1105</span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Young Adult; Prevalence; Urban Population; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control; South Africa; Pregnancy Outcome; Treatment Outcome; South Africa/epidemiology; Prenatal Care; Pregnant Women/*psychology; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*drug therapy; Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use; HIV Infections/*drug therapy; Counseling; antiretroviral treatment; Community Health Services; Community-Based Participatory Research; community-based support; lay health workers; prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is associated with a higher risk of complications, especially when performed without a clear medical indication. Since labour attendants have no standardised clinical method to assist in this decision, statistical tools developed based on multiple labour variables may be an alternative. The objective of this paper was to develop and evaluate the accuracy of models for caesarean section prediction using maternal and foetal characteristics collected at admission and through labour. METHOD: This is a secondary analysis of the World Health Organization's Better Outcomes in Labour Difficulty prospective cohort study in two sub-Saharan African countries. Data were collected from women admitted for labour and childbirth in 13 hospitals in Nigeria as well as Uganda between 2014 and 2015. We applied logistic regression to develop different models to predict caesarean section, based on the time when intrapartum assessment was made. To evaluate discriminatory capacity of the various models, we calculated: area under the curve, diagnostic accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 8957 pregnant women with 12.67% of caesarean births were used for model development. The model based on labour admission characteristics showed an area under the curve of 78.70%, sensitivity of 63.20%, specificity of 78.68% and accuracy of 76.62%. On the other hand, the models that applied intrapartum assessments performed better, with an area under the curve of 93.66%, sensitivity of 80.12%, specificity of 89.26% and accuracy of 88.03%. CONCLUSION: It is possible to predict the likelihood of intrapartum caesarean section with high accuracy based on labour characteristics and events. However, the accuracy of this prediction is considerably higher when based on information obtained throughout the course of labour.","2019-11","2024-02-20 10:59:34","2024-02-20 10:59:34","","165","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">13 hospitals in Nigeria &amp; Uganda</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">8957&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Nigeria; Uganda; Predictive Value of Tests; *Models, Statistical; Caesarean section; Cesarean Section/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data; Decision support models; Logistic regression; Parturition/*psychology; Prediction models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this paper is to examine unintended pregnancy over time in the context of substantial human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence and increasing access to anti-retro viral therapy (ART). METHOD: Data are from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) - a cohort of communities with 10,000-12,000 adults, ages 15-49, in Rakai District, Uganda. We examined prevalence of current pregnancies over time, intended pregnancy, and unintended pregnancies (unwanted, mistimed, ambivalent). We then examined risk factors for the different categories of unintended pregnancy among women who were currently pregnant. The full sample included 32,205 observations over 13 years. RESULTS: The prevalence of mistimed pregnancy and unwanted pregnancy both decreased significantly over time (p < .001). The prevalence of current pregnancies and intended pregnancy showed no significant changes over the thirteen year period. The same overall pattern was found when only examining HIV positive women in the sample; however, the trends were not significant. Out of the 2820 current pregnancies reported, 54.4% were intended, 29.8% were mistimed, 13.2% were unwanted, and 2.5% were ambivalent. After controlling for other predictors, HIV status had no independent effect on mistimed pregnancy but had a significant effect on unwanted pregnancy (RRR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.65-3.61, p < .001] and ambivalent pregnancy [RRR = 2.07; CI: 1.03 to 4.18, p = 0.041]. In 2004, after the introduction of ART, there was a decreased risk in unintended pregnancy [RR = 0.75; CI: 0.66 to 0.84, p < .001]. Women with a secondary education or higher also had a decreased risk in unintended pregnancy [RR = 0.70; CI: 0.70 to 0.92, p = 0.002]. DISCUSSION: HIV was an important predictor of unwanted pregnancy. Unintended pregnancy decreased in the sample over time which may be due to an increase in ART availability and rising levels of education.","2018-02","2024-02-20 10:59:34","2024-02-20 10:59:34","","46","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Communities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">The study was conducted in 28 rural communities in Rakai District, Uganda, as part of the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS)</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>2218</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Uganda; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; *HIV/AIDS; Mothers/*psychology; Pregnancy, Unplanned/*psychology; *Unintended pregnancy; HIV Infections/diagnosis/*psychology; HIV Seropositivity/*psychology; Maternal Behavior/psychology; Pregnancy, Unwanted/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PIMS main hypotheses are that ART initiation in pregnancy and ART-induced hypertension are associated with PTD and SGA respectively and that reconstitution of cellular immune responses in women on ART from before pregnancy results in increases in PTD of GA infants. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women (n=3972) aged >/=18 years regardless of HIV status recruited from 2015 to 2016 into the overall PIMS cohort (2517 HIV-negative, 1455 living with HIV). A nested cohort contained 551 women living with HIV who were </=24 weeks' GA on ultrasound: 261 initiated ART before pregnancy, 290 initiated during the pregnancy. FINDINGS TO DATE: Women in the overall cohort were followed antenatally through to delivery using routine clinical records; further women in the nested cohort were actively followed up until 12 months post partum, with data collected on maternal health (HIV care and ART use, clinical care and intercurrent clinical history). Other procedures conducted on the nested cohort included physical examinations (anthropometry, blood pressure measurement), assessment of fetal growth (ultrasound), maternal and infant phlebotomy for storage of plasma, RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, collection of delivery specimens (placenta and cord blood) and infant 12-month developmental assessment. Preliminary findings have contributed to our understanding of risk factors for adverse birth outcomes, and the relationship between pregnancy immunology, HIV/ART and adverse birth outcomes. FUTURE PLANS: Using specimens collected from study participants living with HIV throughout pregnancy and first year of life, the PIMS provides a valuable platform for answering a variety of research questions focused on temporal changes of immunology markers in women whose immune status is altered by HIV infection, and how ART initiated during the pregnancy affects immune responses. The relationship between these immunological changes with adverse birth outcomes as well as possible longer-term impact of exposure to ART in fetal and early life will be explored. Additionally, further active and passive follow-up of mothers and their infants is planned at school-going age and beyond to chart growth, morbidity and development, as well as changes in family circumstances.","2021-09","2024-02-20 10:59:34","2024-02-20 10:59:34","","e047133","","9","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 9 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: #ffd40080"">Gugulethu Midwife Obstetric Unit</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Public sector primary care facility (Gugulethu Midwife Obstetric Unit (MOU)) subdistrict of Cape Town, South Africa.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">3972</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Mothers; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Infant; Adolescent; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; *public health; *epidemiology; *HIV Infections/complications/drug therapy; *Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/drug therapy; *HIV & AIDS; *immunology; *maternal medicine; Leukocytes, Mononuclear","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Majority of the disorders are Benign Breast Diseases (BBD) with various degrees of associated breast cancer risks. With increasing breast cancer awareness in Nigeria, we sought to determine the prevalence and characteristics of breast disorders among a cohort of pregnant women. METHODS: A longitudinal study of 1248 pregnant women recruited in their first trimester- till 26 weeks gestational age consecutively from selected antenatal clinics (ANCs), in Ibadan, Southwest Nigeria. A pretested interviewer- administered questionnaire was used to collect information at recruitment. Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) using MammaCare(R) technique was performed at recruitment and follow up visits at third trimester, six weeks postpartum and six months postpartum. Women with breast disorders were referred for Breast Ultrasound Scan (BUS) and those with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) >/=4 had ultrasound guided biopsy. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 14. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 29.7 +/- 5.2 years and mean gestational age at recruitment was 20.4 +/- 4.4 weeks. Seventy-two participants (5.8%) had a past history of BBD and 345 (27.6%) were primigravidae. Overall, breast disorder was detected among 223 (17.9%) participants and 149 (11.9%) had it detected at baseline. Findings from the CBE showed that 208 (69.6%) of 299 breast disorders signs found were palpable lumps or thickenings in the breast, 28 (9.4%) were persistent pain, and 63 (21.1%) were abscesses, infection and mastitis. Twenty out of 127 (15.7%) participants who had BUS performed were classified as BIRADS >/=3. Lesions found by BUS were reactive lymph nodes (42.5%), prominent ducts (27.1%), fibroadenoma (9.6%), breast cysts (3.8%) and fibrocystic changes (2.5%). No malignant pathology was found on ultrasound guided biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Breast lump is a major breast disorder among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Ibadan. Routine clinical breast examination and follow up of pregnant women found with breast disorders could facilitate early detection of pregnancy associated breast cancer in low resource settings.","2018-09","2024-02-20 10:59:34","2024-02-20 10:59:34","","152","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 65, 81)"">University College Hospital (UCH), &nbsp;Adeoyo Maternity Hospital (AMH) ,Centre (PHC) Agbongbon health facility</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 65, 81)"">Location Type :</span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 65, 81)"">Health facilities</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 65, 81)"">Description :</span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 65, 81)"">Primary , seconady and tertiary public hospitals which are &nbsp;University College Hospital (UCH), &nbsp;Adeoyo Maternity Hospital (AMH) and Centre (PHC) Agbongbon health facility &nbsp;in Ibadan City , Oyo State Southwestern region of Nigeria</span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 65, 81)"">Sample size :</span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1248&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Nigeria/epidemiology; Prevalence; Longitudinal Studies; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Postpartum Period; *Pregnant women; *Antenatal clinics; *Benign breast diseases; *Clinical breast examination; *Longitudinal; *Post-partum; Breast Diseases/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/pathology; Breast/pathology; Image-Guided Biopsy; Palpation; Physical Examination; Pregnancy Complications/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/pathology; Ultrasonography, Mammary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At inclusion (first antenatal visit, ANV1) women's age, area of residence, schooling, gravidity, gestational age, weight and height were recorded. Thick blood smears were performed on ANV1, second visit (ANV2) and at delivery. In Allada, women's serum ferritin and CRP concentrations were also assessed. The impact of gravidity on maternal haemoglobin (Hb) was analysed using a logistic or linear regression depending on the outcome. The statistical significance was set to P < 0.05. RESULTS: In total, data from 3,591 pregnant women were analysed. Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed a constant association between Hb concentrations and gravidity in the three periods of Hb assessment (ANV1, ANV2 and delivery). Mean Hb concentration was significantly lower in primigravidae than in multigravidae at ANV1 (mean difference = -2.4 g/L, CI 95%: [-3.4, -1.4], P < 0.001). Afterwards, there was a significant increase in primigravidae only, with a tendency to reversal between primigravidae and multigravidae, which was confirmed at delivery (mean difference = 2.8 g/L, CI 95%: [1.3, 4.2], P < 0.001). The prevalence of malaria infection was halved between ANV1 and delivery in primigravidae while it decreased by only 38% among multigravidae, who were less prone to malaria infection (prevalence at ANV1, 20% and 10% respectively). Iron deficiency was more common in multigravidae, and it decreased slightly in this group between ANV1 and delivery. CONCLUSION: In a context of IPTp, Hb levels improved progressively throughout pregnancy in primigravidae, likely as a result of reduction in malaria infection. In multigravidae, the improvement was less perceptible and anaemia was mainly due to iron deficiency.","2012-10","2024-02-20 10:59:34","2024-02-20 10:59:34","","348","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: var(--primary-text)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Kindji Hopital , Kpassé Hopital , Hopital de Zone (Ouidah), Comé central, Ouedeme-Pedah, Akodeha (Comé), Allada, Attogon, Sékou (Allada)</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">The three studies were conducted in rural and semi-rural areas of Benin, with nine maternity clinics serving as study sites</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample Size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">3,591</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Young Adult; Benin/epidemiology; Anemia/*epidemiology; Antimalarials/therapeutic use; Hemoglobins/*analysis; Malaria/*complications/drug therapy/*pathology; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A recent systematic review of 31 studies found that the strongest predictors are social and economic disadvantage and gender-based factors; only six of these studies were community based, and almost all were in South Asia. METHODS: Cohort study nested within 4 weekly surveillance of all women of reproductive age to identify pregnancies and collect data on births and deaths in the Kintampo Health Research Centre study area of Ghana. Women were screened for depression during pregnancy and after birth using the Patient Health Questionnaire to ascertain DSM-IV major or minor depression. Information was collected on determinants relating to the mother, birth, and baby, which were examined using logistic regression; effect sizes reported as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand nine hundred and twenty nine women were screened both during pregnancy and after birth, of whom 13,360 (95.9%) had complete data on potential determinants. Two hundred and fifty five (3.8%, 95% CI: 3.5%, 4.1%) had PND. Antenatal depression (AND) was the strongest determinant accounting for 34.4% of PND cases. Other determinants were season of delivery, peripartum/postpartum complications, newborn ill health, still birth, or neonatal death. Common determinants were observed for onset and persistent depression. CONCLUSIONS: Although most AND resolves in this setting, more than a third of women with PND also had AND. Adverse birth- and baby-related outcomes are the other main determinants. We recommend that programs detect and treat depression during pregnancy and provide support to women with adverse birth outcomes.","2015-02","2024-02-20 10:59:33","2024-02-20 10:59:33","","108-19","","2","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Kintampo Health Research Centre </span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Kintampo Health Research Centre study area of Ghana</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong> <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">13,360</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Risk Factors; Ghana/epidemiology; Self Report; Pregnancy Complications/epidemiology; sub-Saharan Africa; Rural Population/statistics & numerical data; depression; Depression, Postpartum/*epidemiology/etiology; infant ill health; onset; peripartum complications; postnatal; postpartum complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: AMANHI is using harmonised protocols to enrol 3000 women in early pregnancies (8-19 weeks of gestation) for population-based follow-up in pregnancy up to 42 days postpartum in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Tanzania, with collection taking place between August 2014 and June 2016. Urine pregnancy tests will be used to confirm reported or suspected pregnancies for screening ultrasound by trained sonographers to accurately date the pregnancy. Trained study field workers will collect very detailed phenotypic and epidemiological data from the pregnant woman and her family at scheduled home visits during pregnancy (enrolment, 24-28 weeks, 32-36 weeks & 38+ weeks) and postpartum (days 0-6 or 42-60). Trained phlebotomists will collect maternal and umbilical blood samples, centrifuge and obtain aliquots of serum, plasma and the buffy coat for storage. They will also measure HbA1C and collect a dried spot sample of whole blood. Maternal urine samples will also be collected and stored, alongside placenta, umbilical cord tissue and membrane samples, which will both be frozen and prepared for histology examination. Maternal and newborn stool (for microbiota) as well as paternal and newborn saliva samples (for DNA extraction) will also be collected. All samples will be stored at -80 degrees C in the biobank in each of the three sites. These samples will be linked to numerous epidemiological and phenotypic data with unique study identification numbers. Importance of the study: AMANHI biobank proves that biobanking is feasible to implement in LMICs, but recognises that biobank creation is only the first step in addressing current global challenges.","2017-12","2024-02-20 10:59:33","2024-02-20 10:59:33","","021202","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 Place: Scotland","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health Facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>Tanzania, the study is being carried out in two of the four districts or “Shehias” of Pemba, the smaller of the two islands of the Zanzibar archipelago</p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>1000</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; *Pregnancy Outcome; *Developing Countries; Feasibility Studies; *Biomarkers; Biological Specimen Banks/*organization & administration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In sub-Saharan Africa, women often require male partner approval to access and remain engaged in HIV care. Our study will evaluate a promising male engagement intervention (""Homens para Saude Mais"" (HoPS+) [Men for Health Plus]) targeting the elimination of mother-to-child transmission in rural Mozambique. DESIGN: We will use a cluster randomized clinical trial design to engage 24 health facilities (12 intervention and 12 standard of care), with 45 HIV-infected seroconcordant couples per clinic. The planned intervention will engage male partners to address social-structural and cultural factors influencing eMTCT based on new couple-centered integrated HIV services. CONCLUSIONS: The HoPS+ study will evaluate the effectiveness of engaging male partners in antenatal care to improve outcomes among HIV-infected pregnant women, their HIV-infected male partners, and their newborn children. Our objectives are to: (1) Implement and evaluate the impact of male-engaged, couple-centered services on partners' retention in care, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, early infant diagnosis uptake, and mother-to-child transmission throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding; (2) Investigate the impact of HoPS+ intervention on hypothesized mechanisms of change; and (3) Use validated simulation models to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HoPS+ intervention with the use of routine clinical data from our trial. We expect the intervention to lead to strategies that can improve outcomes related to partners' retention in care, uptake of services for HIV-exposed infants, and reduced MTCT.","2018-08","2024-02-20

We aimed to assess the efficacy of fortified BEP supplementation during pregnancy to improve birth outcomes, as compared to iron-folic acid (IFA) tablets, the standard of care. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted an individually randomized controlled efficacy trial (MIcronutriments pour la SAnte de la Mere et de l'Enfant [MISAME]-III) in 6 health center catchment areas in rural Burkina Faso. Pregnant women, aged 15 to 40 years with gestational age (GA) <21 completed weeks, were randomly assigned to receive either fortified BEP supplements and IFA (intervention) or IFA (control). Supplements were provided during home visits, and intake was supervised on a daily basis by trained village-based project workers. The primary outcome was prevalence of small-for-gestational age (SGA) and secondary outcomes included large-for-gestational age (LGA), low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), gestational duration, birth weight, birth length, Rohrer's ponderal index, head circumference, thoracic circumference, arm circumference, fetal loss, and stillbirth. Statistical analyses followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. From October 2019 to December 2020, 1,897 pregnant women were randomized (960 control and 937 intervention). The last child was born in August 2021, and birth anthropometry was analyzed from 1,708 pregnancies (872 control and 836 intervention). A total of 22 women were lost to follow-up in the control group and 27 women in the intervention group. BEP supplementation led to a mean 3.1 percentage points (pp) reduction in SGA with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -7.39 to 1.16 (P = 0.151), indicating a wide range of plausible true treatment efficacy. Adjusting for prognostic factors of SGA, and conducting complete cases (1,659/1,708, 97%) and per-protocol analysis among women with an observed BEP adherence >/=75% (1,481/1,708, 87%), did not change the results. The intervention significantly improved the duration of gestation (+0.20 weeks, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.36, P = 0.010), birth weight (50.1 g, 8.11 to 92.0, P = 0.019), birth length (0.20 cm, 0.01 to 0.40, P = 0.044), thoracic circumference (0.20 cm, 0.04 to 0.37, P = 0.016), arm circumference (0.86 mm, 0.11 to 1.62, P = 0.025), and decreased LBW prevalence (-3.95 pp, -6.83 to -1.06, P = 0.007) as secondary outcomes measures. No differences in serious adverse events [SAEs; fetal loss (21 control and 26 intervention) and stillbirth (16 control and 17 intervention)] between the study groups were found. Key limitations are the nonblinded administration of supplements and the lack of information on other prognostic factors (e.g., infection, inflammation, stress, and physical activity) to determine to which extent these might have influenced the effect on nutrient availability and birth outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The MISAME-III trial did not provide evidence that fortified BEP supplementation is efficacious in reducing SGA prevalence. However, the intervention had a small positive effect on other birth outcomes. Additional maternal and biochemical outcomes need to be investigated to provide further evidence on the overall clinical relevance of BEP supplementation.

The spread of SP parasite resistance has raised concerns regarding long-term use for IPT. Mefloquine (MQ) is the most promising of available alternatives to SP based on safety profile, long half-life, and high efficacy in Africa. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of MQ for IPTp compared to those of SP in HIV-negative women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 4,749 pregnant women were enrolled in an open-label randomized clinical trial conducted in Benin, Gabon, Mozambique, and Tanzania comparing two-dose MQ or SP for IPTp and MQ tolerability of two different regimens. The study arms were: (1) SP, (2) single dose MQ (15 mg/kg), and (3) split-dose MQ in the context of long lasting insecticide treated nets. There was no difference on low birth weight prevalence (primary study outcome) between groups (360/2,778 [13.0%]) for MQ group and 177/1,398 (12.7%) for SP group; risk ratio [RR], 1.02 (95% CI 0.86-1.22; p=0.80 in the ITT analysis). Women receiving MQ had reduced risks of parasitemia (63/1,372 [4.6%] in the SP group and 88/2,737 [3.2%] in the MQ group; RR, 0.70 [95% CI 0.51-0.96]; p=0.03) and anemia at delivery (609/1,380 [44.1%] in the SP group and 1,110/2743 [40.5%] in the MQ group; RR, 0.92 [95% CI 0.85-0.99]; p=0.03), and reduced incidence of clinical malaria (96/551.8 malaria episodes person/year [PYAR] in the SP group and 130/1,103.2 episodes PYAR in the MQ group; RR, 0.67 [95% CI 0.52-0.88]; p=0.004) and all-cause outpatient attendances during pregnancy (850/557.8 outpatients visits PYAR in the SP group and 1,480/1,110.1 visits PYAR in the MQ group; RR, 0.86 [0.78-0.95]; p=0.003). There were no differences in the prevalence of placental infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes between groups. Tolerability was poorer in the two MQ groups compared to SP. The most frequently reported related adverse events were dizziness (ranging from 33.9% to 35.5% after dose 1; and 16.0% to 20.8% after dose 2) and vomiting (30.2% to 31.7%, after dose 1 and 15.3% to 17.4% after dose 2) with similar proportions in the full and split MQ arms. The open-label design is a limitation of the study that affects mainly the safety assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Women taking MQ IPTp (15 mg/kg) in the context of long lasting insecticide treated nets had similar prevalence rates of low birth weight as those taking SP IPTp. MQ recipients had less clinical malaria than SP recipients, and the pregnancy outcomes and safety profile were similar. MQ had poorer tolerability even when splitting the dose over two days. These results do not support a change in the current IPTp policy.

However, growing resistance to SP threatens the effectiveness of IPTp-SP, and alternative drugs are needed. This study tested the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of a fixed-dose combination azithromycin-chloroquine (AZCQ; 250 mg AZ/155 mg CQ base) for IPTp relative to IPTp-SP. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A randomized, Phase 3, open-label, multi-center study was conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (Benin, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda) between October 2010 and November 2013. Pregnant women received 3 IPTp courses with AZCQ (each course: 1,000/620 mg AZCQ QD for 3 days) or SP (each course 1,500/75 mg SP QD for 1 day) at 4- to 8-week intervals during the second and third trimester. Long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets were also provided at enrollment. Study participants were followed up until day 28 post delivery (time window: day 28-42). The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with sub-optimal pregnancy outcomes (a composite endpoint comprising live-borne neonates with low birth weight [LBW, <2,500 g], premature birth [<37 weeks], still birth [>28 weeks], abortion [</=28 weeks], lost to follow-up prior to observation of pregnancy outcome, or missing birth weight). The study was terminated early after recruitment of 2,891 of the planned 5,044 participants, due to futility observed in a pre-specified 35% interim analysis. In the final intent-to-treat dataset, 378/1,445 (26.2%) participants in the AZCQ and 342/1,445 (23.7%) in the SP group had sub-optimal pregnancy outcomes, with an estimated risk ratio (RR) of 1.11 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.25; p = 0.12). There was no significant difference in the incidence of LBW between treatment groups (57/1138 [5.0%] in the AZCQ group, 68/1188 [5.7%] in the SP group, RR 0.87 [95% CI: 0.62, 1.23]; p = 0.44). IPTp-AZCQ was less well-tolerated in mothers than IPTp-SP. Occurrences of congenital anomalies, deaths, and serious adverse events were comparable in neonates for both groups. Limitations included the open-label design and early study termination. CONCLUSIONS: IPTp-AZCQ was not superior to IPTp-SP in this study and alternatives for IPTp-SP remain to be identified. The proportions of sub-optimal pregnancy outcomes and LBW were lower than expected, which may be linked to insecticide-treated bednet use throughout the study. Reduced incidences of symptomatic malaria infection and peripheral parasitemia in the AZCQ group relative to SP suggest that AZCQ warrants further investigation as an alternative treatment of uncomplicated malaria.

We compared continuous monitoring using a novel nine-crystal FHR monitor (Moyo) versus intermittent single crystal Doppler (Doppler) for the detection of abnormal FHR. Methods: An unmasked randomised controlled study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Tanzania (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02790554). A total of 2973 low-risk singleton pregnant women in the first stage of labour admitted with normal FHR were randomised to either Moyo (n = 1479) or Doppler (1494) arms. The primary outcome was the proportion of abnormal FHR detection. Secondary outcomes were time intervals in labour, delivery mode, Apgar scores, and perinatal outcomes. Results: Moyo detected abnormal FHR more often (13.3%) compared to Doppler (9.8%) (p = 0.002). Time intervals from admission to detection of abnormal FHR were 15% shorter in Moyo (p = 0.12) and from the detection of abnormal FHR to delivery was 36% longer in Moyo (p = 0.007) compared to the Doppler arm. Time from last FHR to delivery was 12% shorter with Moyo (p = 0.006) compared to Doppler. Caesarean section rates were higher with the Moyo device compared to Doppler (p = 0.001). Low Apgar scores (<7) at the 1st and 5th min were comparable between groups (p = 0.555 and p = 0.800). Perinatal outcomes (fresh stillbirths and 24-h neonatal deaths) were comparable at delivery (p = 0.497) and 24-h post-delivery (p = 0.345). Conclusions: Abnormal FHR detection rates were higher with Moyo compared to Doppler. Moyo detected abnormal FHR earlier than Doppler, but time from detection to delivery was longer. Studies powered to detect differences in perinatal outcomes with timely responses are recommended.","2019-01","2024-02-20 10:59:32","2024-02-20 10:59:32","","","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 3 Place: Switzerland","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Muhimbili National Hospital</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</span></span></p> <p><strong>sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">2973</span></span></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Cesarean Section; Stillbirth; Tanzania; *Doppler; *foetal heart rate; *Heart Rate, Fetal; *Moyo; *perinatal outcomes; Apgar Score; Fetal Monitoring/*instrumentation; Heart Rate Determination/*instrumentation; Tertiary Care Centers; Ultrasonography, Doppler/*instrumentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Jamii Bora (""Better Family"" in Swahili) Study, we seek to test the efficacy of an interdependence theory-based couple intervention. The intervention reaches pregnant women and male partners through home visits by male-female pairs of lay health workers. The aim is to increase access to home-based couples' HIV testing and counseling services to improve family health. METHODS: This is a three-arm randomized control trial among 1080 pregnant women 15 years of age or older, living with their male partners, and who have not undergone couples' HIV testing and counseling in Kisumu and Migori Counties in Kenya. Couples will be randomized into three groups: home-based couple visits, HIV self-testing kits for couple use, or standard care (male partner clinic invitation letters). Participants will be followed up to 18 months postpartum. The study has three aims: in aim 1, we will determine the effects of the intervention on our primary outcome of couple HIV testing, compared to HIV self-testing kits and standard care; in aim 2, we will examine the intervention impact on HIV prevention behaviors, facility delivery, and postnatal healthcare utilization, as well as secondary health outcomes of maternal viral suppression and HIV-free child survival up to 18 months for couples living with HIV; and in aim 3, we will compare the cost-effectiveness of the home-based couple intervention to the less resource-intensive strategies used in the other two study arms. Assessments with couples are conducted at baseline, late pregnancy, and at months 3, 6, 12, and 18 after birth. DISCUSSION: The results from this study will inform decision-makers about the cost-effective strategies to engage pregnant couples in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission and family health, with important downstream benefits for maternal, paternal, and infant health.

Where they are in place, their quality is not optimal. This study was initiated to assess the relationship between these suboptimal maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services and perinatal mortality (PM) in Lubumbashi, DRC's second-largest city. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study, comparing women who had no, low, moderate, or high numbers of antenatal care (ANC) visits; three different levels of delivery care; and who did or did not attend postnatal care (PNC). Women were followed for 50 days after delivery, with PM as the primary endpoint. RESULTS: Uptake of recommended prenatal interventions was between 11-43% among ANC attenders, regardless of the frequency of their visits. PM was 26 per 1000. ANC attendance was associated with PM. Newborns of mothers who had the lowest attendance had a mortality two times higher than newborns of women who had not attended ANC (low visits: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-3.8). However, moderate (aOR = 1.4; 95% CI =0.7-2.2) and high (aOR = 1.3; 95% CI 0.7-2.2) attendance were not statistically significantly associated with PM. PNC attendance was not significantly associated with lower PM (relative risk 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-2.6). Emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) was significantly associated with a reduction in mortality (aOR = 0.2; 95% CI = 0.2-0.8), with an 84.4% reduction among newborns at risk, and an overall reduction in mortality of 10% for all births. CONCLUSION: Perinatal mortality was high among the infants of women in the cohort under study (26 per 1000 live births). Availability of MNCH, specifically EmONC, was associated with lower perinatal mortality, and if this association is causal, might avert 84.4% of perinatal deaths among newborns at high-risk.","2016-04","2024-02-20 10:59:31","2024-02-20 10:59:31","","89","","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location name</strong> <strong>: </strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> &nbsp;<strong>:</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>: </strong></p> <p>Health facilities (urban and rural health facilities) in Lubumbashi city , Katanga province/region DRC</p> <p><strong>Sample size : &nbsp;</strong></p> <p>4304</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Democratic Republic of the Congo; *Perinatal Mortality; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data; Perinatal mortality; Democratic Republic of the Congo/epidemiology; Postnatal care; Emergency obstetric and neonatal care; Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data; Maternal health services; Maternal-Child Health Services/*statistics & numerical data; Perinatal care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within a package of interventions to prevent MiP in endemic areas, the WHO currently recommends intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp). Concerns about anti-malarial resistance have however prompted interest in intermittent screening and treating (IST) as an alternative approach to IPTp. IST involves screening for malaria infection at scheduled antenatal care (ANC) clinic visits and treating malaria cases. In light of the need to comprehensively evaluate new interventions prior to roll out, this article explores the acceptability of IST with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) compared to IPTp with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and in Upper East Region, northern Ghana. METHODS: Data were collected alongside an open-label, randomized, controlled trial of IST-AL and IPTp-SP in Kassena-Nankana District. Thirty pregnant women enrolled in the clinical trial participated in six focus group discussions. Ten in-depth interviews were carried out with clinical trial staff. Observations were also made at the health facilities where the clinical trial took place. RESULTS: Trial participants were generally willing to endure the discomfort of the finger prick necessary for a rapid diagnostic test for malaria and this reflected a wider demand for diagnostic techniques. Reports of side effects were however linked to both trial anti-malarials. Direct complaints about SP were particularly severe with regard to women's experience of vomiting. Although the follow-up treatment doses of AL for IST were not supervised, based on blister inspection and questioning trial, staff were confident about participants' adherence to the treatment course. One case of partial adherence to the AL treatment course was reported. CONCLUSION: Despite the discomfort of the finger prick required to perform the intermittent malaria screening, trial participants generally expressed more positive sentiments towards IST-AL than IPTp-SP. Nonetheless, questions remain about adherence to a multiple dose anti-malarial regimen during pregnancy, particularly in endemic areas where MiP is often non-symptomatic. Any implementation of IST must be accompanied by appropriate health messages on adherence and the necessary training for health staff regarding case management.","2014-11","2024-02-20 10:59:31","2024-02-20 10:59:31","","432","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Names not specified</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Kassena-Nankana District in Ghana</span></span></p> <p><strong>sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">5,000&nbsp;</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Ghana; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Adolescent; *Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Interviews as Topic; Mass Screening/methods; *Health Services Administration; Malaria/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*prevention & control; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most modelling estimates are based on studies using inaccurate methods of gestational age assessment. We aimed to fill this gap by measuring the population-based burden of preterm birth using early ultrasound dating in five countries in South-Asian and sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We identified women early in pregnancy (<20 weeks based on last menstrual period) by home visits every 2-3 months (except in Zambia where they were identified at antenatal care clinics) in 5 research sites in South-Asia and sub-Saharan Africa between July 2012 and September 2016. Trained sonographers performed an ultrasound scan for gestational age dating. Women were enrolled if they were 8-19 weeks pregnant on ultrasound. Women <8 weeks were rescheduled for repeat scans after 4 weeks, and identified women were followed through pregnancy until 6 weeks postpartum. Site-specific rates and proportions were calculated and a logistic regression model was used to predict the risk factors of preterm birth. RESULTS: Preterm birth rates ranged from 3.2% in Ghana to 15.7% in Pakistan. About 46% of all neonatal deaths occurred among preterm infants, 49% in South Asia and 40% in sub-Saharan Africa. Fourteen percent of all preterm infants died during the neonatal period. The mortality was 37.6% for early preterm babies (<34 weeks), 5.9% for late preterm babies (34 to <37 weeks), and 1.7% for term babies (37 to <42 weeks). Factors associated lower gestation at birth included South-Asian region (adjusted mean difference (Adj MD) = -6.2 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -5.5, -6.9), maternal morbidities (Adj MD = -3.4 days, 95% CI = -4.6, -2.2), multiple pregnancies (Adj MD = -17.8 days, 95% CI = -19.9,-15.8), adolescent pregnancy (Adj MD = -2.7 days, 95% CI = -3.7, -1.6) and lowest wealth quintile (Adj MD = -1.3 days, 95% CI = -2.4, -0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth rates are higher in South Asia than in sub-Saharan Africa and contribute to 49% and 40% of all neonatal deaths in the two regions, respectively. Adolescent pregnancy and maternal morbidities are modifiable risk factors associated with preterm birth.","2022","2024-02-20 10:59:31","2024-02-20 10:59:31","","04011","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Scotland","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Kintampo, &nbsp;Pemba, </p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Communities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Five community sites in South-Asia (Sylhet, Bangladesh, and Karachi, Pakistan), sub-Saharan Africa (Kintampo, Ghana; Pemba, Tanzania; and Southern Province, Zambia)</p> <p><strong>sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Ghana (N=976) ,Tanzania (N=2427) ,Zambia (N=981)</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Ghana; Infant, Newborn; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Infant; Adolescent; Pakistan; Infant, Premature; *Premature Birth/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generalised estimating equations were used to conduct hypothesis-driven and exploratory multivariable analyses in the panel at 2.5 and 3.5 years. RESULTS: The prevalence of maternal fatigue was 8.3% at 2.5 years and 5.5% at 3.5 years post-partum. Psychological symptoms of maternal CMD were associated independently with complaints of fatigue after adjusting for anaemia, body mass index, physical ill health, poverty and other confounding variables: adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-1.66 for each one point increase in SRQ score. In the multivariable model, only psychosocial factors (CMD and stressful life events) and self-reported physical ill health were associated significantly with complaints of fatigue. CONCLUSION: Complaints of fatigue are associated strongly with maternal CMD and other psychosocial risk factors in this rural, low-income country setting with a high burden of undernutrition and infectious disease. Fatigue should be understood as a potential indicator of CMD in primary care to improve detection and treatment.","2016-03","2024-02-20 10:59:31","2024-02-20 10:59:31","","365-72","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 3 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Butajira DSS</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Communities</span></span></p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Butajira District, Gurage Zone, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1065&nbsp;</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Adolescent; Hemoglobins/analysis; Ethiopia; Ethiopia/epidemiology; Body Mass Index; Developing Countries/*statistics & numerical data; Health Status; low-and middle-income countries; angustia psicosocial; detresse psychosociale; DMC materno; estudio poblacional de paneles; Ethiopie; Etiopia; etude de panel basee sur la population; fatiga; fatigue; Fatigue/epidemiology/*etiology; maternal CMD; PFR-PRI; PIBMs; population-based panel study; Pregnancy Complications/epidemiology/psychology; psychosocial distress; Stress, Psychological/*complications/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seasonality may influence the outcome of prenatal nutrition interventions that aim to enhance fetal growth. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated seasonal modifications of the efficacy of a randomized controlled prenatal nutrition intervention trial in pregnant women to improve fetal growth in rural Burkina Faso. METHODS: The second Micronutriments et Sante de la Mere et de l'Enfant study compared a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) fortified with multiple micronutrients (MMNs) to an MMN supplement. Truncated Fourier series were used to characterize seasonality in birth outcomes. Models that included the Fourier series and newborn and maternal characteristics were used to assess seasonal effect modifications of prenatal supplementation on birth outcomes. RESULTS: Birth weight, birth length, small for gestational age as a proxy for intrauterine growth retardation, and preterm birth were significantly related to date of birth and showed important seasonal variations. LNSs, which supply energy in addition to MMNs, resulted in a significant increase in birth length (+13.5 mm, 95% CI: 6.5, 20.5 mm) at the transition from rain to dry season (September to November) compared to MMNs alone. CONCLUSIONS: The climatologic and agricultural seasonal patterns in Burkina Faso affect the efficacy of prenatal LNSs on birth length. In this context, prenatal MMN supplementation programs should be complemented by energy supplementation during the annual rain season to promote fetal growth. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00909974.","2015-03","2024-02-20 10:59:31","2024-02-20 10:59:31","","634-9","","3","145","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 3 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong> &nbsp;</p> <p>Health Facility and surrounding community</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Catchment area of <span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)"">2 health centers in the Houndé health district of Burkina Faso, West Africa</span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)"">1296&nbsp;</span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; *Dietary Supplements; *Rural Population; Young Adult; Gestational Age; Logistic Models; Premature Birth; Nutritional Status; *Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; *Birth Weight; Burkina Faso; Linear Models; Fetal Development; pregnant women; birth length; birth weight; Fetal Growth Retardation; food supplement; Micronutrients/*administration & dosage; premature birth; seasonal variations; small for gestational age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Venous blood samples were obtained for complete blood counts at both study visits. Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality were also recorded. The data were analyzed using SPSS (version 23). RESULTS: Two thousand pregnant women were recruited. The prevalence of anemia was 42.7% (n = 854/2000) at the first antenatal visit. Thirty-five percent had mild anemia and 68.9% had normocytic normochromic anemia. The prevalence of anemia in HIV infected women was higher than that in the noninfected group and 47.2% of the study population (n = 2000) was HIV infected. At the 32-34 weeks visit, hemoglobin (Hb) levels were available for 1433/2000 (71.7%) of the participants. The prevalence of anemia was 28.1% (n = 403/1433); 19.3% had mild anemia and 65.3% had normocytic normochromic anemia. There was a significant difference in Hb levels between that of the first visit and that at 32-34 weeks (42.7% vs. 28.1%; p = .001; 95% CI: 0.11-0.18). There were significant differences in prematurity, birth weight and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy between the anemic and nonanemic groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anemia decreased from 42.7% (booking) to 28.1% (32 - 34 weeks). Normocytic normochromic anemia was the commonest type of anemia.

Global health","","2214-109X (LINKING)","10.1016/S2214-109X(15)00219-3","","BACKGROUND: Access to injectable uterotonics for management of postpartum haemorrhage remains limited in Senegal outside health facilities, and misoprostol and oxytocin delivered via Uniject have been deemed viable alternatives in community settings. We aimed to compare the efficacy of these drugs when delivered by auxiliary midwives at maternity huts. METHODS: We did an unmasked cluster-randomised controlled trial at maternity huts in three districts in Senegal. Maternity huts with auxiliary midwives located 3-21 km from the closest referral centre were randomly assigned (1:1; via a computer-generated random allocation overseen by Gynuity Health Projects) to either 600 mug oral misoprostol or 10 IU oxytocin in Uniject (intramuscular), stratified by reported previous year clinic volume (deliveries) and geographical location (inland or coastal). Maternity huts that had been included in a previous study of misoprostol for prevention of postpartum haemorrhage were excluded to prevent contamination. Pregnant women in their third trimester were screened for eligibility either during community outreach or at home-based prenatal visits. Only women delivered by the auxiliary midwives in the maternity huts were eligible for the study. Women with known allergies to prostaglandins or pregnancy complications were excluded. The primary outcome was mean change in haemoglobin concentration measured during the third trimester and after delivery. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01713153. FINDINGS: 28 maternity hut clusters were randomly assigned-14 to the misoprostol group and 14 to the oxytocin group. Between June 6, 2012, and Sept 21, 2013, 1820 women were recruited. 647 women in the misoprostol group and 402 in the oxytocin group received study drug and had recorded pre-delivery and post-delivery haemoglobin concentrations, and overall 1412 women delivered in the study maternity huts. The mean change in haemoglobin concentrations was 3.5 g/L (SD 16.1) in the misoprostol group and 2.7 g/L (SD 17.8) in the oxytocin group. When adjusted for cluster design, the mean difference in haemoglobin decreases between groups was not significant (0.3 g/L, 95% CI -8.26 to 8.92, p=0.71). Both drugs were well tolerated. Shivering was common in the misoprostol group, and nausea in the oxytocin group. Postpartum haemorrhage was diagnosed in one woman allocated to oxytocin, who was referred and transferred to a higher-level facility for additional care, and fully recovered. No other women were transferred. INTERPRETATION: In terms of effects on haemoglobin concentrations, neither oxytocin nor misoprostol was significantly better than the other, and both drugs were safe and efficacious when delivered by auxiliary midwives. The programmatic limitations of oxytocin, including short shelf life outside the cold chain, mean that misoprostol could be more appropriate for community-level prophylaxis of postpartum haemorrhage.

METHODS: A total of 82 clusters in Burkina Faso, Uganda and South Africa were randomised to either the intervention or the control arm. Feeding data and anthropometric measurements were collected at visits scheduled 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks post-partum. We calculated weight-for-length (WLZ), length-for-age (LAZ) and weight-for-age (WAZ) z-scores. Country specific adjusted Least Squares Means with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a longitudinal analysis are reported. Prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between peer counselling for EBF and wasting (WLZ < -2), stunting (LAZ < -2) and underweight (WAZ < -2) were calculated at each data collection point. RESULTS: The study included a total of 2,579 children. Adjusting for socio-economic status, the mean WLZ at 24 weeks were in Burkina Faso -0.20 (95% CI -0.39 to -0.01) and in Uganda -0.23 (95% CI -0.43 to -0.03) lower in the intervention than in the control arm. In South Africa the mean WLZ at 24 weeks was 0.23 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.43) greater in the intervention than in the control arm. Differences in LAZ between the study arms were small and not statistically significant. In Uganda, infants in the intervention arm were more likely to be wasted compared to those in the control arm at 24 weeks (PR 2.36; 95% CI 1.11 to 5.00). Differences in wasting in South Africa and Burkina Faso and stunting and underweight in all three countries were small and not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: There were small differences in mean anthropometric indicators between the intervention and control arms in the study, but in Uganda and Burkina Faso, a tendency to slightly lower ponderal growth (weight-for-length z-scores) was found in the intervention arms.

Group ANC (G-ANC) is an intervention designed to improve the experience and provision of ANC for groups of women (cohorts) at similar stages of pregnancy. Methods: A two-arm, two-phase, cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) (non-blinded) is being conducted in Kenya and Nigeria. Public health facilities were matched and randomized to either standard individual ANC (control) or G-ANC (intervention) prior to enrollment. Participants include pregnant women attending first ANC at gestational age <24 weeks, health care providers, and sub-national health managers. Enrollment ended in June 2017 for both countries. In the intervention arm, pregnant women are assigned to cohorts at first ANC visit and receive subsequent care together during five meetings facilitated by a health care provider (Phase 1). After birth, the same cohorts meet four times over 12 months with their babies (Phase 2). Data collection was performed through surveys, clinical data extraction, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews. Phase 1 data collection ended in January 2018 and Phase 2 concludes in November 2018. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to evaluate primary outcomes for Phases 1 and 2: health facility delivery and use of a modern method of family planning at 12 months postpartum, respectively. Data analysis and reporting of results will be consistent with norms for cRCTs. General estimating equation models that account for clustering will be employed for primary outcome analyzes. Results: Overall 1,075 and 1,013 pregnant women were enrolled in Nigeria and Kenya, respectively. Final study results will be available in February 2019.

Methods: Pregnant women attending antenatal clinics (ANC) and their male partners were recruited in 14 clinics in the eastern and central regions of Kenya and randomly allocated to intervention or control arms at a ratio of 1:1:1. Arm 1 received the standard of care, which involved invitation of the male partner to the clinic through word of mouth, arm 2 received an improved invitation letter, and arm 3 received the same improved letter and, two self-testing kits. Analysis was done using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) at 95% confidence intervals (CI) to calculate and determine effects of HIV self-testing in increasing uptake of male partner testing. Results: A total of 1410 women and 1033 men were recruited; 86% (1217) women and 79% (1107) couples were followed up. In arm 3, over 80% (327) of male partners took HIV test, compared to only 37% (133) in arm 2 and 28% (106) in arm one. There was a statistical significance between arm one and two (p-value=0.01) while arm three was statistically significant compared to arm two (p-value<0.001). Men in arm three were twelve times more likely to test compared to arm one (aOR 12.45 (95% CI 7.35, 21.08)). Conclusion: Giving ANC mothers test kits and improved male invitation letter increased the likelihood of male partner testing by twelve times.

Respiratory medicine","","2213-2600 (LINKING)","10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30479-5","","BACKGROUND: Maternal influenza immunisation can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection in pregnant women and young infants. We aimed to determine the vaccine efficacy of maternal influenza immunisation against maternal and infant PCR-confirmed influenza, duration of protection, and the effect of gestational age at vaccination on vaccine efficacy, birth outcomes, and infant growth up to 6 months of age. METHODS: We did a pooled analysis of three randomised controlled trials done in Nepal (2011-2014), Mali (2011-2014), and South Africa (2011-2013). Pregnant women, gestational age 17-34 weeks in Nepal, 28 weeks or more in Mali, and 20-36 weeks in South Africa, were enrolled. Women were randomly assigned 1:1 to a study group, in which they received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in all three trials, or a control group, in which they received saline placebo in Nepal and South Africa or quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine in Mali. Enrolment at all sites was complete by April 24, 2013. Infants and women were assessed for respiratory illness, and samples from those that met the case definition were tested for influenza by PCR testing. Growth measurements, including length and weight, were obtained at birth at all sites, at 24 weeks in South Africa, and at 6 months in Nepal and Mali. The three trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01430689, NCT01034254, and NCT02465190. FINDINGS: 10 002 women and 9800 liveborn infants were included. Pooled efficacy of maternal vaccination to prevent infant PCR-confirmed influenza up to 6 months of age was 35% (95% CI 19 to 47). The pooled estimate was 56% (28 to 73) within the first 2 months of life, 39% (11 to 58) between 2 and 4 months, and 19% (-9 to 40) between 4 and 6 months. In women, from enrolment during pregnancy to the end of follow-up at 6 months postpartum, the vaccine was 50% (95% CI 32-63) efficacious against PCR-confirmed influenza. Efficacy was 42% (12 to 61) during pregnancy and 60% (36 to 75) postpartum. In women vaccinated before 29 weeks gestational age, the estimated efficacy was 30% (-2 to 52), and in women vaccinated at or after 29 weeks, efficacy was 71% (50 to 83). Efficacy was similar in infants born to mothers vaccinated before or after 29 weeks gestation (34% [95% CI 12 to 51] vs 35% [11 to 52]). There was no overall association between maternal vaccination and low birthweight, stillbirth, preterm birth, and small for gestational age. At 6 months of age, the intervention and control groups were similar in terms of underweight (weight-for-age), stunted (length-for-age), and wasted (weight-for-length). Median centile change from birth to 6 months of age was similar between the intervention and the control groups for both weight and length. INTERPRETATION: The assessment of efficacy for women vaccinated before 29 weeks gestational age might have been underpowered, because the point estimate suggests that there might be efficacy despite wide CIs. Estimates of efficacy against PCR-confirmed influenza and safety in terms of adverse birth outcomes should be incorporated into any further consideration of maternal influenza immunisation recommendations.

Counseling can leverage the motivation women have during this time to change behaviors that may negatively affect their health and the heath of their infants. METHODS: Pregnant women attending an antenatal clinic in South Africa were randomly allocated to treatment (n=733) and control arms (n=747). Treatment arm participants received enhanced HIV pre- and post-test counseling, legal support and access to support groups at baseline, which occurred at the first antenatal visit, and then six and ten weeks postpartum. Control arm participants received standard HIV testing and counseling (HTC) and two postpartum attention control sessions. Outcomes were incidence of sexually transmitted infection (STI) by 14 weeks postpartum and past 30-day inconsistent condom use at 14 weeks and 9 months postpartum. RESULTS: There were no intervention effects on incident STIs for either HIV-negative (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.71-1.44) or HIV-positive participants (aRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61-1.23). The intervention was associated with a 28% decrease in risk of past 30-day inconsistent condom use at nine-months among HIV-negative women (aRR 0.72,95% CI 0.59-0.88), but did not affect inconsistent condom use among HIV-positive women (aRR1.08; 95% CI 0.67-1.75). DISCUSSION: An enhanced counseling intervention during pregnancy and the postpartum period can lead to reductions in inconsistent condom use among HIV-negative women. Results underscore the importance of the counseling that accompanies HIV HTC. More work is needed to understand how to promote and sustain risk reduction among HIV-positive women.

Early-life worm exposure may be critical, but this has not been fully investigated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether worms in pregnancy and in early childhood are associated with childhood eczema incidence. METHODS: The Entebbe Mother and Baby Study, an anthelminthic treatment trial, enrolled pregnant women between 2003 and 2005 in Uganda. Mothers were investigated for worms during pregnancy and children annually. Eczema was doctor-diagnosed from birth to age five years. A planned observational analysis was conducted within the trial cohort to investigate associations between worms and eczema. RESULTS: Data for 2345 live-born children were analysed. Hookworm was the most prevalent maternal worm (45%). Childhood worms were less prevalent. Eczema incidence was 4.68/100 person-years. Maternal hookworm was associated with reduced eczema incidence [adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), p-value: 0.71(0.51-0.99), 0.04] and modified effects of known risk factors for eczema: Dermatophagoides-specific IgE in children was positively associated with eczema incidence if the mother had no hookworm [2.72(1.11-6.63), 0.03], but not if the mother had hookworm [0.41(0.10-1.69), 0.22], interaction p-value = 0.03. Similar interactions were seen for maternal history of eczema {[2.87(1.31-6.27, 0.008) vs. [0.73(0.23-2.30), 0.60], interaction p-value = 0.05}, female gender {[1.82(1.22-2.73), 0.004 vs. [0.96(0.60-1.53), 0.87], interaction p-value = 0.04} and allergen-specific IgE. Childhood Trichuris trichiura and hookworm were inversely associated with eczema. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal hookworm modifies effects of known risk factors for eczema. Mechanisms by which early-life worm exposures influence allergy need investigation. Worms or worm products, and intervention during pregnancy have potential for primary prevention of allergy.","2014-08","2024-02-20 10:59:39","2024-02-20 10:59:39","","481-8","","5","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 5 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Communities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Peri-urban, fishing and rural communities beside Lake victoria, Uganda</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">2345&nbsp;</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Incidence; Pregnancy; Cohort Studies; Infant, Newborn; Uganda/epidemiology; Male; Risk Factors; Child, Preschool; Infant; Uganda; Double-Blind Method; pregnancy; Proportional Hazards Models; children; Albendazole/therapeutic use; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*immunology; incidence; eczema; IgE; Anthelmintics/therapeutic use; birth cohort; Eczema/*epidemiology; effect modification; hookworm; Hookworm Infections/drug therapy/*immunology; skin prick test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to assess vertical transmission of HIV among pregnant women who initially had false-negative rapid HIV tests in South African antenatal care (ANC) clinics. METHODS: Pregnant participants were enrolled in a diagnostic study that used nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) to screen for early HIV infection among individuals who tested negative on rapid HIV tests used at the point-of-care (POC) facilities. Participants were enrolled from four ANC clinics in the Tshwane district of South Africa. All NAAT-positive participants were recalled to the clinics for further management. Vertical transmission was assessed among exposed infants whose HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results were available. RESULTS: This study enrolled 8208 pregnant participants who tested negative on rapid HIV tests between 2013 and 2016. Their median age was 26 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23-30). NAAT detected HIV infections in 0.6% (n = 49; 95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.5-0.8) of all study participants. The distribution of these infections among the four clinics ranged from 0.3%- 1.1%, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). Forty-seven participants (95.9%) were successfully recalled and referred for antiretroviral treatment initiation as part of prevention of MTCT (PMTCT). Most women with newly diagnosed HIV infection presented for the first ANC visit in the second (61.9%, n = 26) and third (31.0%, n = 13) trimesters. HIV PCR results were available for thirty-two infants, three of whom tested positive (9.4%; 95% CI: 1.98-25.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that supplemental HIV testing for pregnant women led to earlier linkage to the PMTCT programme. Inaccurate diagnosis of HIV infection at ANC clinics is likely to undermine the efforts of eliminating MTCT particularly in HIV-endemic settings.","2019","2024-02-20 10:59:39","2024-02-20 10:59:39","","e0226391","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 12 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facility</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong> <span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Four ANC clinics in the Tshwane district of South Africa</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(32, 32, 32)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">8208&nbsp;</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Infant; South Africa; Point-of-Care Systems; Mass Screening; Anti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use; Prenatal Care/methods; numerical data; Maternal Age; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/prevention & control/*statistics &; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/drug therapy/*virology; False Negative Reactions; HIV Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy/transmission; HIV/*genetics; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: We analyzed 5,099 observations of 1,236 mothers and their children from pregnancy to 5 years postbirth, within a longitudinal cluster-randomized trial evaluating the effect of a home visiting intervention on mothers in Cape Town, South Africa. Paraprofessional home visitors coached mothers on coping with multiple risk factors, including a brief, 1-visit intervention on alcohol prevention in pregnancy. We assessed changes in maternal drinking over time in relation to the intervention, and then examined the impact of these drinking patterns on child outcomes over five years. RESULTS: Drinking increased over the 5 years postbirth, but it was significantly lower in the intervention condition. Compared with abstinence, mothers' problematic drinking was associated with decreased child weight (-0.21 z-units) at all assessments, increased child aggressive behavior (3 to 7 additional symptoms), and decreased child performance on an executive functioning measure (the silly sounds task; odds ratio = .34) at 3 and 5 years. The intervention's effect was associated with increased child aggression (0.25 to 0.75 of 1 additional symptom), but the intervention appeared to decrease the effect of problem drinking on children's aggressive acts and executive functioning. CONCLUSION: These findings support the need for sustained interventions to reduce alcohol use, especially for mothers who exhibit problematic drinking. Maternal drinking influences children's health and development over time.

The MRC Guidance on complex interventions proposes that interventions and implementation strategies be shaped by early phase piloting and development work. We present the findings of a three-month mixed-methodology feasibility study for this trial, describe how this was informed by the MRC guidance and the study design was refined. METHODS: The fidelity, dose, feasibility and acceptability of implementation and training materials were assessed in three representative non-trial sites (Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, India) using multiple-choice questionnaires, evaluation of clinical management (action log), healthcare provider (HCP) semi-structured interviews and focus groups 4-10 weeks after implementation. Simultaneously, the 10 sites included in the main trial (eight countries) collected primary outcome data to inform the power calculation and randomisation allocation and assess the feasibility of data collection. RESULTS: The package was implemented with high fidelity (85% of HCP trained, n = 204). The questionnaires indicated a good understanding of device use with 75% of participants scoring > 75% (n = 97; 90% of those distributed). Action logs were inconsistently completed but indicated that the majority of HCP responded appropriately to abnormal results. From 18 HCP interviews and two focus groups it was widely reported that the intervention improved capacity to make clinical decisions, escalate care and make appropriate referrals. Nine of the ten main trial sites achieved ethical approval for pilot data collection. Intensive care was an inconsistent marker of morbidity and stroke an infrequent outcome and therefore they were removed from the main trial composite outcome. Tools and methods of data collection were optimized and event rates used to inform randomisation. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study demonstrates that the components of the intervention were acceptable, methods of implementing were successful and the main trial design would be feasible. Qualitative work identified key moderators that informed the main trial process evaluation. Changes to the training package, implementation strategy, study design and processes were identified to refine the implementation in the main trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 3 March-12 November 2014, we conducted a prospective cohort study of UA lactate levels at Kalafong Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa. Following birth, a UA blood sample (<0.5uL) was taken from a double-clamped segment of cord and the lactate measured. Maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: During the study, there were 4668 deliveries; including 1091 emergency cesarean and 154 instrumental deliveries.

Although the World Health Organization recommends use of oxytocin for prevention of PPH, misoprostol use is increasingly common owing to advantages in shelf life and potential for sublingual administration. There is a lack of data about the comparative efficacy of oxytocin and sublingual misoprostol, particularly at the recommended dose of 600 microg, for prevention of PPH during active management of labor. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a double-blind, double-dummy randomized controlled non-inferiority trial between 23 September 2012 and 9 September 2013 at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda. We randomized 1,140 women to receive 600 microg of misoprostol sublingually or 10 IU of oxytocin intramuscularly, along with matching placebos for the treatment they did not receive. Our primary outcome of interest was PPH, defined as measured blood loss >/= 500 ml within 24 h of delivery. Secondary outcomes included measured blood loss >/= 1,000 ml; mean measured blood loss at 1, 2, and 24 h after delivery; death; requirement for blood transfusion; hemoglobin changes; and use of additional uterotonics. At 24 h postpartum, primary PPH occurred in 163 (28.6%) participants in the misoprostol group and 99 (17.4%) participants in the oxytocin group (relative risk [RR] 1.64, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.05, p<0.001; absolute risk difference 11.2%, 95% CI 6.44 to 16.1). Severe PPH occurred in 20 (3.6%) and 15 (2.7%) participants in the misoprostol and oxytocin groups, respectively (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.58, p = 0.391; absolute risk difference 0.9%, 95% CI -1.12 to 2.88). Mean measured blood loss was 341.5 ml (standard deviation [SD] 206.2) and 304.2 ml (SD 190.8, p = 0.002) at 2 h and 484.7 ml (SD 213.3) and 432.8 ml (SD 203.5, p<0.001) at 24 h in the misoprostol and oxytocin groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups in any other secondary outcomes. Women in the misoprostol group more commonly experienced shivering (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.21, p<0.001) and fevers (RR 5.20, 95% CI 3.15 to 7.21, p = 0.005). This study was conducted at a regional referral hospital with capacity for emergency surgery and blood transfusion. High-risk women were excluded from participation. CONCLUSIONS: Misoprostol 600 microg is inferior to oxytocin 10 IU for prevention of primary PPH in active management of labor. These data support use of oxytocin in settings where it is available. While not powered to do so, the study found no significant differences in rate of severe PPH, need for blood transfusion, postpartum hemoglobin, change in hemoglobin, or use of additional uterotonics between study groups.

METHODS: AMANHI takes advantage of on-going population-based cohort studies covering approximately 2 million women of reproductive age with 1- to 3-monthly pregnancy surveillance to enrol pregnant women. Morbidity information is collected at five follow-up home visits - three during the antenatal period at 24-28 weeks, 32-36 weeks and 37+ weeks of pregnancy and two during the postpartum period at 1-6 days and after 42-60 days after birth. Structured-questionnaires are used to collect self-reported maternal morbidities including hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, infections, difficulty in labor and obstetric fistula, as well as care-seeking for these morbidities and outcomes for mothers and babies. Additionally, structured questionnaires are used to interview birth attendants who attended women's deliveries. All protocols were harmonised across the sites including training, implementation and operationalising definitions for maternal morbidities. IMPORTANCE OF THE AMANHI MORBIDITY STUDY: Availability of reliable data to synthesize evidence for policy direction, interventions and programmes, remains a crucial step for prioritization and ensuring equitable delivery of maternal health interventions especially in high burden areas. AMANHI is one of the first large harmonized population-based cohort studies being conducted in several rural centres in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and is expected to make substantial contributions to global knowledge on maternal morbidity burden and its implications.","2016-12","2024-02-20 10:59:38","2024-02-20 10:59:38","","020601","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 Place: Scotland","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Democratic Republic of Congo (Equator), Ghana (Kintampo), Kenya (Western province), Tanzania (Pemba), and Zambia (Southern Province Zambia).</span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p>Health facilities communities</p> <p><strong>Description</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Democratic Republic of Congo (Equator), Ghana (Kintampo), Kenya (Western province), Tanzania (Pemba), and Zambia (Southern Province Zambia).</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample siz</strong>e <strong>:</strong></p> <p>52232 (combined)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Female; Humans; Mothers; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; *Pregnancy Outcome; Africa South of the Sahara/epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications/*epidemiology; Self Report; Rural Population; Developing Countries; *Maternal Health; *Severity of Illness Index; Delivery, Obstetric; Research Design; Asia/epidemiology; Morbidity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although some limited data on mono infection of HIV, Hepatitis B and C virus infections do exists, that of dual and triplex infections, including seroconversion and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rates necessary for planning to address the scourge of infections in pregnancy are not available. OBJECTIVES: To determine the seroprevalence, rate of new infections, MTCT of dual and triple infections of HIV, Hepatitis B and C viruses and associated factors, among pregnant women in Nigeria. METHOD: A multicenter prospective cohort study will be conducted in six tertiary health facilities randomly selected from the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. All eligible pregnant women are to be tested at enrollment after informed consent for HIV, Hepatitis B and C virus infections. While those positive for at least two of the infections in any combination will be enrolled into the study and followed up to 6 weeks post-delivery, those negative for the three infections or positive for only one of the infections at enrolment will be retested at delivery using a rapid diagnostic test. On enrolment into the study relevant information, will be obtained, and laboratory test of CD4 count, liver function test and full blood counts, and prenatal ultrasonography will also be obtained/performed. Management of mother-newborns pairs will be according to appropriate national guidelines. All exposed newborns will be tested for HIV, HBV or HCV infection at birth and 6 weeks using PCR technique. The study data will be documented on the study case record forms. Data will be managed with SPSS for windows version 23. Ethical approval was obtained from National Health Research Ethics Committee (NHREC) (NHREC/01/01/2007-23/01/2020). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with multiple of HIV, HBV and HCV infections are at increased risk of hepatotoxicity, maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Additionally, infected pregnant women transmit the virus to their unborn baby even when asymptomatic. Children born with any of the infection have significantly poorer quality of life and lower five-year survival rate. Unfortunately, the seroconversion and MTCT rates of dual or triplex infections among pregnant women in Nigeria have not been studied making planning for prevention and subsequent elimination of the viruses difficult. The study is expected to fill this knowledge gaps. Nigeria joining the rest of the world to eliminate the triple infection among children rest on the availability of adequate and reliable data generated from appropriately designed, and powered study using representative population sample. The establishment of the three-in-one study of prevalence, rate of new infection, rate and risk factor for MTCT of dual and triple infection of HIV, Hepatitis B and C viruses among pregnant women in Nigeria is urgently needed for policy development and planning for the improvement of the quality of life of mothers and the elimination of childhood triplex infection.","2020-09","2024-02-20 10:59:37","2024-02-20 10:59:37","","144","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Place: England","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital,<br>Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital,<br>Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital , University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, </span></span></p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Health facility</span></span></p> <p><strong>Description</strong> &nbsp;<strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Six tertiary health facilities from &nbsp;six geopolitical zones of Nigeria</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size :</strong></p> <p>2180</p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Nigeria; HIV; Dual infection; HBV; HCV; Multiple infection; Seroconversion; Triplex infection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: A prospective 4-year observational study. SETTING: Senegal and Mali. SAMPLE: A cohort of 9712 women with one previous caesarean delivery. METHODS: Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between 8083 women who underwent a TOL and 1629 women who had an ERCS. Perinatal and maternal outcomes were then stratified according to the presence or absence of risk factors associated with vaginal birth after caesarean section. These outcomes were adjusted on maternal, perinatal and institutional characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The risks of uterine rupture, maternal complication and perinatal mortality associated with TOL after one previous caesarean as compared with ERCS, RESULTS: The risks of hospital-based maternal complication [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.52; 95% CI 1.09-2.13; P = 0.013] and perinatal mortality (adjusted OR 4.53; 95% CI 2.30-9.92; P < 0.001) were significantly higher in women with a TOL compared with women who had an ERCS. However, when restricted to low-risk women, these differences were not significant (adjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.55-1.46, P = 0.68, and adjusted OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.75-1.86; P = 0.53, for each outcome, respectively). Uterine rupture occurred in 25 (0.64%) of 3885 low-risk women compared with 70 (1.66%) of 4198 women with unfavourable risk factors.

Most women with GDM in LMICs are undiagnosed and/or inadequately managed due to a lack of knowledge and skills about GDM on the part of both providers and patients. Following contextual analysis, we developed an educational/behavioural intervention for GDM delivered through a package of culturally tailored films. This trial aims to evaluate whether the intervention can improve the timely detection and management of GDM in two LMIC settings. METHODS: Two independent cluster randomised controlled trials, one each to be conducted in Uganda and India. Thirty maternity facilities in each country have been recruited to the study and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms. The intervention comprises of three interconnected sets of films with the following aims: to improve knowledge of GDM guidelines and skills of health providers, to raise awareness of GDM screening among pregnant women and their families, and to improve confidence and skills in self-management among those diagnosed with GDM. In facilities randomised to the intervention arm, a GDM awareness-raising film will be shown in antenatal care waiting rooms, and four films for pregnant women with GDM will be shown in group settings and made available for viewing on mobile devices. Short films for doctors and nurses will be presented at professional development meetings. Data will be collected on approximately 10,000 pregnant women receiving care at participating facilities, with follow-up at 32 weeks gestational age and 6 weeks postnatally. Women who self-report a GDM diagnosis will be invited for a clinic visit at 34 weeks. Primary outcomes are (a) the proportion of women who report a GDM diagnosis by 32 weeks of pregnancy and (b) glycaemic control (fasting glucose and HbA1C) in women with GDM at ~34 weeks of pregnancy. The secondary outcome is a composite measure of GDM-related adverse perinatal-neonatal outcome. DISCUSSION: Screening and management of GDM are suboptimal in most LMICs. We hypothesise that a scalable film-based intervention has the potential to improve the timely detection and management of GDM in varied LMIC settings.

METHODS: The Zambian Preterm Birth Prevention Study enrolled pregnant women at their first antenatal visit in Lusaka. Participants underwent ultrasound, laboratory testing, and clinical phenotyping of delivery outcomes. Key exposures were maternal HIV serostatus and timing of antiretroviral therapy initiation. We defined the primary outcome, PTB, as delivery between 16 and 37 weeks' gestational age, and differentiated spontaneous from provider-initiated parturition. RESULTS: Of 1450 pregnant women enrolled, 350 (24%) had HIV. About 1216 (84%) were retained at delivery, 3 of whom delivered <16 weeks. Of 181 (15%) preterm deliveries, 120 (66%) were spontaneous, 56 (31%) were provider-initiated, and 5 (3%) were unclassified. In standardized analyses using inverse probability weighting, maternal HIV increased the risk of spontaneous PTB [RR 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 2.52], but this effect was mitigated on overall PTB [risk ratio (RR) 1.31; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.86] owing to a protective effect against provider-initiated PTB. HIV reduced the risk of preeclampsia (RR 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.91), which strongly predicted provider-initiated PTB (RR 17.92; 95% CI: 8.13 to 39.53). The timing of antiretroviral therapy start did not affect the relationship between HIV and PTB. CONCLUSION: The risk of HIV on spontaneous PTB seems to be opposed by a protective effect of HIV on provider-initiated PTB. These findings support an inflammatory mechanism underlying HIV-related PTB and suggest that published estimates of PTB risk overall underestimate the risk of spontaneous PTB.","2021-06","2024-02-20 10:59:36","2024-02-20 10:59:36","","860-868","","2","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 Place: United States","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong>Location Information</strong></p> <p><strong>Location Name :</strong></p> <p>Names not specified</p> <p><strong>Location Type :</strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong>Description :</strong></p> <p>Participants<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)""> residing within Lusaka with no plans to relocate during the study follow-up period, were enrolled in antenatal clinics.</span></span></p> <p><strong>Sample size</strong> <strong>:</strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">1450</span></span></p> </div>","","","eppi-reviewer4; Adult; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Gestational Age; Zambia/epidemiology; Prenatal Care; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active/*adverse effects; Anti-HIV Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Pre-Eclampsia/*epidemiology; Ultrasonography; HIV Infections/drug therapy/*physiopathology; Premature Birth/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phase I, conducted 2008-2015, consisted of nine complementary studies designed to describe optimal human growth and neurodevelopment, based conceptually on the WHO prescriptive approach. The studies generated a set of international standards for monitoring growth and neurodevelopment, which complement the existing WHO Child Growth Standards. Phase II aims to improve the functional classification of the highly heterogenous preterm birth and fetal growth restriction syndromes through a better understanding of how environmental exposures, clinical conditions and nutrition influence patterns of human growth from conception to childhood, as well as specific neurodevelopmental domains and associated behaviors at 2 years of age.,  Methods: In the INTERBIO-21 st Newborn Case-Control Study, a major component of Phase II, our objective is to investigate the mechanisms potentially responsible for preterm birth and small for gestational age and their interactions, using deep phenotyping of clinical, growth and epidemiological data and associated nutritional, biochemical, omic and histological profiles.

The subsequent introduction of IPT was associated with halving of malaria, but no additional haematological benefit over haematinics.                        ,                                                             Objectif                  Evaluer l'effet des programmes de supplémentation hématinique prénatales de routine et celui du traitement préventif intermittent (TPI) au sulfadoxine–pyriméthamine (SP) au Kenya.                                               Méthodes                  L'anémie simple (hémoglobine [Hb] <11 g/dl), l'anémie sévère (Hb < 8 g/dl), et la malaria placentaire ont été comparées chez des femmes au statut VIH connu qui ont accouché dans un hôpital provincial après leur inclusion dans l’étude au cours du 3                                  trimestre selon trois périodes consécutives. Période 1: aucune intervention de routine (référence), période 2: supplémentation hématinique de routine (60 mg de fer élémentaire 3 fois/jour, 5 mg d'acide folique par jour), période 3: supplémentation hématinique et TPI au SP.                                               Résultats                  Chez les 3108 participants, les prévalences de malaria placentaire, d'anémie simple et d'anémie sévère post‐partum étaient de 16,7%; 53,6% et 12,7% respectivement. Comparées à la période 1, les femmes dans la période 2 étaient moins anémiques (rapport de cotes ajustés [AOR] pour l'anémie simple = 0,56 avec une intervalle de confiance [IC] 95%: 0,47–0,67 et pour l'anémie sévère AOR = 0,37, IC95%: 0,28–0,49) et partageaient une prévalence similaire de malaria placentaire (AOR = 1,07, IC95%: 0,86–1,32). Les femmes dans la période 3 étaient également moins anémiques (AOR pour l'anémie = 0,43; IC95%: 0,35–0,5 et pour l'anémie sévère: 0,43; IC95%: 0,31–0,59) et avaient moins de malaria placentaire (AOR = 0,56; IC95%: 0,42–0,73). Il n'y avait pas différence significative dans l'effet de l'intervention selon le statut VIH.                                               Conclusion                  Le programme de supplémentation hématinique était associéà des réductions significatives de l'anémie chez les femmes VIH‐séropositives et VIH‐séronégatives. L'introduction du TPI en plus a été associée à une réduction de moitié de la malaria, mais aucun avantage hématologique additionnel n'a été observé pour les hématiniques.                                       ,                                                             Objetivo                  Evaluar el efecto de los programas de suplementación hematínica antenatal rutinaria y el tratamiento preventivo intermitente (IPT) con sulfadoxina–pirimetamina (SP) en Kenia.                                               Métodos                  Se compararon la anemia (Hemoglobina [Hb] <11 g/dl), la anemia severa (Hb < 8 g/dl) y la malaria placentaria entre mujeres con estatus de VIH conocido, que hubiesen dado a luz en un hospital provincial después de haber sido enroladas en el estudio durante el 3er timestre de embarazo. La comparación se hizo en tres períodos consecutivos: Período 1: sin intervención de rutina (referencia); Período 2: suplementación hematínica rutinaria (60 mg hierro elemental 3 veces/día, ácido fólico 5 mg una vez al día); Período 3: suplementación hematínica e IPT con SP.                                               Resultados                  La prevalencia de malaria placentaria, anemia y anemia severa entre las 3108 participantes fue del 16.7%, 53.6%, y 12.7%, respectivamente. Con respecto al Periodo 1, las mujeres estaban menos anémicas durante el Periodo 2 (riesgo relativo indirecto [RRI], 95% intervalo de confianza para anemia: 0.56, 0.47–0.67; anemia severa 0.37, 0.28–0.49) y compartían una prevalencia similar para la malaria placentaria (RRI 1.07, 0.86–1.32). Durante el Periodo 3, las mujeres también estaban menos anémicas (RRI anemia: 0.43, 0.35–0.53; anemia severa: 0.43, 0.31–0.59), y tenían menos malaria placentaria (RRI 0.56, 0.42–0.73). El efecto de la intervención no difirió significativamente según el estatus de VIH.                                               Conclusión                  El programa de suplementación hematínica estaba asociado a reducciones significativas de la anemia en mujeres seropositivas y seronegativas para VIH. La introducción posterior del IPT estaba asociada con una disminución de la malaria, sin beneficios hematológicos adicionales a aquellos hematínicos.","2007-03","2024-05-27 14:35:11","2024-05-27 14:35:11","2024-05-27 14:35:11","342-352","","3","12","","Tropical Med Int Health","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location information</span></span></strong></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Name :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Nyanza Provincial General Hospital, Kisumu </span></span>Health facility</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Location Type :</span></span></strong></p> <p>Health facilities</p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Description :</span></span></strong></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(28, 43, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Nyanza Provincial General Hospital, Kisumu, western Kenya</span></span></p> <p><strong><span style=""color: black""><span style=""background-color: white"">Sample size :</span></span></strong></p> <p>3155</p> <p></p> </div>","C:\Users\leon.mbano\Zotero\storage\XRNYTLUM\Van Eijk et al. - 2007 - Effect of haematinic supplementation and malaria p.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
